Instructions for compiling and installing MightEMacs.

This distribution includes 64-bit binaries and make files for the CentOS Linux,
Debian Linux, OS X, and Red Hat Linux platforms.  If you are installing on a
different platform, the installation scripts will automatically select and use
the appropriate make files from the included platforms for compilation.
However, compilation on other platforms has not been tested, so it is possible
that there may be errors.  If this occurs, please contact the author with the
details so that the problem can be resolved.  (See the ReadMe.md file for
contact information.)  For reference, make file locations are (for example,
Debian): geeklib-1.1.0/debian/Makefile and memacs-8.3.0/debian/Makefile.  The
make files use "cc" to run the compiler.

To install MightEMacs, perform the following steps:

 1. MightEMacs 64-bit binaries are included for CentOS Linux (vers. 6 and
    later), Debian Linux (vers. 8 and later), OS X (vers. 10.6 and later), and
    Red Hat Linux (RHEL 6 and later).  If you want to use one of these binaries
    and skip compilation, go to step 6; otherwise, go to the next step.

 2. Remove package binaries.

	$ make clean

 3. Review and/or edit beginning portion of memacs-8.3.0/src/edef.h to customize
    MightEMacs compilation (optional).

 4. Review and/or edit memacs-8.3.0/src/ebind.h if you want to change the
    default key bindings (not recommended).

 5. To see a list of available platforms (optional):

	$ make

 6. Build and/or link MightEMacs.  This will create files "libgeek.a" in the
    geeklib directory and "mm" in the memacs directory.  Note that if you are
    compiling the sources, you may see several "... may be used uninitialized
    ..." or other warnings with some compilers.  These may be ignored.

    To proceed, supply the desired platform name in lower case as the value of
    the PLATFORM variable; for example, Debian:

	$ make PLATFORM=debian

 7. Install MightEMacs.  If you have superuser privileges and want to do a
    site-wide install, go to the next step; otherwise, go to step 10.

 8. Perform a site-wide install:

	$ su root
	# make install
	# exit

 9. Go to step 12.

10. Perform a local (user) install.  Supply the pathname of the local
    installation directory as the value of the INSTALL variable; for example,
    "$HOME/MightEMacs":

	$ make install INSTALL=$HOME/MightEMacs

11. Modify your shell startup file in your HOME directory so that the shell can
    find the MightEMacs binary and MightEMacs can find its startup files.  For
    example, if you are using the Bourne shell, add the following two lines to
    file $HOME/.profile:

	export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/MightEMacs/bin"
	export MMPATH=":$HOME/MightEMacs/etc:$HOME/MightEMacs/etc/memacs.d"

12. If you want to install the sample user startup file (.memacs) into your HOME
    directory (and rename any existing file to ".memacs.old"):

	$ make user-install
 
13. Review and/or edit file "site.mm" in the .../etc/memacs.d installation
    directory to customize site-wide defaults for the editor.  Note that
    MightEMacs can be run with the command "memacs" or "mm".
