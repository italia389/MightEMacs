Instructions for Installing MightEMacs

Installer packages are included for the macOS platform and Linux platforms
(CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).  The standard
installation packages place files in /usr/local and require superuser (root)
privileges.  If you are not installing on a macOS or GNU/Linux platform, want to
install MightEMacs in your HOME directory, or want to customize the installation
process, please refer to file CustomInstall.txt for instructions.

For a standard installation of MightEMacs, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this Install.txt file:

	$ cd MightEMacs-master

 2. Note that if you already have MightEMacs installed (in /usr/local), the
    installers will save any existing site.ms file in /usr/local/lib/memacs as
    site.ms.bak.

    If you are installing on a Linux platform, go to the next step; otherwise,
    go to step 5.

 3. The Linux installer is memacs-9.4.0.sh, which includes a 64-bit binary built
    on a CentOS vers. 6 machine.  To run the installer, type the following
    commands:

	$ su root
	# ./memacs-9.4.0.sh
	# exit

 4. Go to step 6.

 5. The macOS installer is memacs-9.4.0.pkg, which includes a 64-bit binary
    built for macOS vers. 10.10 (Yosemite) and later.  Open the installer
    package with the following command:

	$ open memacs-9.4.0.pkg

    and run the installer.

 6. If you want to install the sample user startup file (.memacs) into your HOME
    directory, enter the following command:

	$ cp memacs-9.4.0/lib/.memacs ~

 7. Make sure directory /usr/local/bin is in your shell PATH so that the shell
    can find the MightEMacs binary.  Display it with the following command:

	$ echo $PATH

    If you need to add it, modify the site startup file for the shell that you
    are using.  For example, add the following line to file /etc/profile for the
    Bourne shell (bash) or file /etc/zshenv for zsh:

	export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

    To determine your shell, enter the following command:

	$ echo $0

    MightEMacs looks for its startup files in directory /usr/local/lib/memacs by
    default.  If you want to create your own scripts in another directory (for
    example, "$HOME/scripts"), you can include it in the MMPATH environmental
    variable so that MightEMacs will search that directory also.  To accomplish
    this, add this line to the startup file you modified above:

	export MMPATH=":/usr/local/lib/memacs:$HOME/scripts"

 8. Review and/or edit file /usr/local/lib/memacs/site.ms to customize site-wide
    defaults for the editor, such as scrolling options, the search string
    delimiter, etc.  If an old version of the file was saved in step 3 or 5, you
    may have to change settings in the new "site.ms" file to match the old
    settings because some of the syntax may have changed, depending on the
    previous version of MightEMacs you were using.

Note that MightEMacs can be run with the command "memacs" or "mm" with optional
switches and/or arguments.  See memacs(1) for details.
