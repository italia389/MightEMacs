Instructions for compiling and installing MightEMacs.

 1. Edit include/os.h and select a platform (OS).

 2. Create .platform file, which contains the platform name in lower case; for
    example, SOLARIS:

	$ echo 'solaris' >.platform

 3. Create directories for platform if needed:

	$ make platform

 4. If platform is OSX or REDHAT, go to next step; otherwise, go to step 8.

 5. The MightEMacs binary (mm) for the OSX and REDHAT platforms is included in
    this distribution.  If you want to use it (and skip compilation), go to next
    step; otherwise, go to step 9.

 6. Link binary:

	$ make link

 7. Go to step 13.

 8. Create makefiles for geeklib and memacs, using "Makefile" from OSX or REDHAT
    platform as template.  Generally, you should just need to change CFLAGS and
    LDFLAGS, if anything.  Makefile locations are (for example, SOLARIS):
    geeklib-1.0.0/solaris/Makefile and memacs-8.0.0/solaris/Makefile.

 9. Compile geeklib sources.  This will create file "libgeek.a" in the geeklib
    directory:

	$ make geeklib

10. Review and/or edit beginning portion of memacs-8.0.0/src/edef.h to customize
    MightEMacs compilation (optional).

11. Review and/or edit memacs-8.0.0/src/ebind.h if you want to change the
    default key bindings (not recommended).

12. Compile MightEMacs sources.  This will create file "mm" in the memacs
    directory.  Note that you may see several "... may be used uninitialized ..."
    warnings with some older compilers.  These may be ignored:

	$ make memacs

13. If you want to strip the binary before it is installed (recommended):

	$ make strip

14. Install MightEMacs (in /usr/local):

	$ sudo make install

15. Review and/or edit /usr/local/etc/memacs.d/site.mm to customize site-wide
    defaults for the editor.
