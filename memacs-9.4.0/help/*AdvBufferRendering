~bBuffer Rendering~B

As explained in the ~bWindows~B section, you can create multiple windows in
MightEMacs, which is especially useful for working with multiple buffers.  It
can be tedious however, to set up the windows the way you want them.  MightEMacs
provides some help with this by employing the following convention.  Mostly all
buffer and file commands may be given a numeric prefix in the range -3 to +3,
which controls the disposition or "rendering" of its buffer after the command
completes.  The values of the numeric prefix and their actions are:

    < -2        Display the buffer in a different window and switch to that
                window.
    -2          Display the buffer in a different window but stay in the current
                window.
    -1          Display the buffer in a pop-up window.  If the buffer was just
                created, delete it after the window is dismissed.
    0           Leave the buffer as is (usually in the background).
    1           Switch to the buffer in the current window (the default action).
    2           Display the buffer in a new window but stay in the current
                window.
    > 2         Display the buffer in a new window and switch to that window.

Note that -2 and -3 use an existing window if possible, whereas 2 and 3 always
create a window for the buffer.

If the buffer does not exist and n == -1 (a pop-up request), an error is
generated; otherwise, the buffer is created.  Additionally, if n <= -2 and
multiple windows exist, the buffer is displayed in a window already displaying
the buffer, or the window immediately above the current one if possible.
                        
These numeric prefixes take a little while to learn and get used to, but they
can definitely give you better control of your editing sessions.  Here are some
examples:

    ~#uC-u 3 C-x C-f~U       Find a file, display it in a new window, and switch to
                        it.
    ~#uC-- C-x C-r~U         Display the on-disk version of a file in a pop-up window
                        (whether or not it is currently being edited) and delete
                        the temporary buffer after the window is dismissed.
    ~#uC-- C-x C-f~U         Display a file in a pop-up window, using any existing
                        buffer attached to that file (instead of the on-disk
                        version) if it exists.  If a buffer was created, delete
                        it after the window is dismissed.
    ~#uC-u C-x b~U           Select a buffer (creating it if necessary) and display
                        it in a new window.
    ~#uC-- 3 C-x #~U         Create a scratch buffer in a different (existing)
                        window and switch to it.  If only one window exists,
                        create another one.
    ~#uC-u C-u C-x C-f~U     Find a file, but don't select its buffer (to be edited
                        later).  Leave its buffer in the background.

You can also use the "popFile" (~#uC-h C-p~U) or "popBuf" (~#uC-h p~U) command to display
a file or buffer in a pop-up window.  These commands are designed just for this
purpose and provides options for controlling how the pop-up window is displayed
(like left-shifting long lines).  A common use of the "popFile" command is to
pop a file on disk during an editing session, scroll through it, then dismiss
the window and return to where you left off.  See the "showCommands"
descriptions for details.
