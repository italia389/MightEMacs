~bText Objects~B

MightEMacs includes a system for text manipulation which allows you to delete,
copy, and move portions of text around in a buffer with minimal keystrokes.  The
basic process is to identify the text "object", like a word or line, then
perform some action on the object, like copy or delete.

The boundaries of all text objects depend on the point.  Its current position
marks one boundary of an object.  The one exception to this is a line object.
Its boundaries are always the beginning and end of the line, including the
delimiter at the end; however, the point identifies the first line of a group of
lines (a "line block").

Word objects are defined as one or more contiguous characters of the set of
characters that are contained in the $wordChars system variable.  The variable's
default value is "A-Za-z0-9_", but it can be changed at any time.

The complete list of text objects follows:

    ~bObject          Description~B

    Word            One or more contiguous $wordChars characters going forward
                    or backward from point, including any non-word characters
                    between point and the word.
    Partial line    One or more characters going forward or backward from point
                    to a line break.  If no characters exist, the line break
                    (newline) is selected.
    Line            A line in the buffer, including its newline delimiter.
    Region          All text from point to mark '.' (which may comprise zero
                    characters).
    Fenced region   All text from a fence character at point to and including
                    its matching fence character (forward or backward).  Fence
                    pairs are ~u(~U ~u)~U, ~u{~U ~u}~U, ~u[~U ~u]~U, and ~u<~U ~u>~U.

A "region" exists at all times and is defined as all text between the point and
the "dot mark", which is initially placed at the end of a buffer.  Marks are
visible characters which are used to mark point positions in a buffer.  Mark '.'
is special in that it always exists (cannot be deleted), and is used to
delineate a region.  To set mark '.' at the current point position, you use the
"setMark" (~uC-SPC~U) command.
