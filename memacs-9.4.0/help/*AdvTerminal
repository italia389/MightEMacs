~bTerminal Dimensions~B

Part of MightEMacs's startup processing is to map its screen to the size of the
terminal window.  The number of columns and rows being used are saved in the
$TermSize constant.

The editor can also re-map its screen during an editing session if the size of
the terminal window changes; for example, when resizing the terminal window with
a mouse or changing the orientation of a smart phone from portrait to landscape
(or vice versa).  When the terminal window changes size, MightEMacs usually is
aware of it and updates the screen dimensions automatically; however, you can
update the dimensions manually as well by entering ~#uESC ESC~U (resetTerm).
