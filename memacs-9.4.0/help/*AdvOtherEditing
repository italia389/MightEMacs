There are a few other editing commands not yet discussed that are very useful
and worth mentioning.  They are grouped below.

                                    without word wrap or text replacement if
                                    n < 0.
    ~#uC-x SPC~U     insertSpace         Insert abs(n) spaces ahead of point, forcing
                                    text insertion if n < 0.

                                    immediately before point.  If n > 0, non-

                                    If the current line is not blank, blank
                                    lines immediately below it will be deleted,
                                    or immediately above it if n < 0.

                                    immediately following point.

Inserting lines:

                                    text replacement if n < 0.
    ~uC-j~U         newlineI            Insert n lines with same indentation as
                                    previous line (default 1).

                                    1).  If n < 0, also move point to first
