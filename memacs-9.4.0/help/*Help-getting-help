~bGetting Help~B

You may be wondering by now what commands are available and what key(s) invoke
them.  MightEMacs provides several ways to get assistance during an editing
session in addition to using this Help System.  To find out what a particular
key or key sequence does, enter ~#uC-h ?~U (showKey) followed by the key(s).  For
example, try this: press ~#uC-h ?~U and at the prompt, type ~#uC-x C-s~U.  MightEMacs
displays the following in a pop-up window:

     ~u                                                                     ~U
    | ~bsaveFile~B        ~#uC-x C-s~U                                             |
    |     Save current buffer (if changed) to its associated file (or all |
    |     changed buffers if n argument).                                 |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |~r=* (Exact) == untitled ============================ MightEMacs 9.4.0 ~B|
    | End: ~b_~B                                                              |
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

(Recall that you can press ~uESC~U or ~uq~U to dismiss the window.)  This is the command
we used earlier in the ~bIntroduction~B section.  Now type ~#uC-u C-u C-h ? C-h~U.  You
will see the following on the ~bmessage line~B instead:

    |~r=* (Exact) == untitled ============================ MightEMacs 9.4.0 ~B|
    |~uC-h~U -> ~bprefix3~B - Begin prefix 3 key sequence.                        |
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you supply a zero or negative numeric prefix to the "showKey" command, it
reads a single keystroke from the keyboard, as in this case where it displayed
the binding for a prefix key.  It also will display the key description on the
message line instead of in a pop-up window if the numeric prefix is zero or
positive, as it also did in this case.  The pop-up window display is the default
however, which is useful when the command or macro description is lengthy and
may be truncated on the message line.  Type ~#uC-h ? C-x b~U to see an example of
this.

MightEMacs also provides informational displays via other "show" commands, which
are all bound to a key sequence that begins with ~uC-h~U.  For example, to see all
commands and their bindings, press ~#uC-h c~U (showCommands).  Scroll down to near
the bottom of the list and notice that there are several other "show" commands
as well, which you may want to try.

There is one additional command in the "show" family which combines the output
from the "showCommands" (~#uC-h c~U), "showMacros" (~#uC-h @~U), "showFunctions" (~#uC-h f~U),
"showAliases" (~#uC-h a~U), and "showVariables" (~#uC-h v~U) commands:

    apropos     ~#uESC a~U

This command prompts for a search string, scans the names from all the
aforementioned commands, and displays all the items that contain the string you
entered, ignoring case.  If the string entered is null, all output is displayed:

    |~r=* (Exact) == untitled ============================ MightEMacs 9.4.0 ~B|
    |Apropos name: ~b_~B                                                      |
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also enter a search pattern instead of a string to perform case-
sensitive or regular expression matching.  (Searching with patterns is explained
later in the ~bSearching and Replacing~B section.)

Lastly, each of the "show" commands called by "apropos" has a built-in "apropos"
function.  To use this feature, simply enter a numeric prefix to the command.
For example, to find all the "show" commands, enter ~#uC-- C-h c~U and type "show" or
"^show:r" at the prompt.  (The numeric prefix must be negative to view the
results in a pop-up window.)
