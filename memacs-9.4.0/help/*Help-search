~bSearching and Replacing~B

There is a group of commands for searching for a pattern in a buffer and
optionally, replacing one or more occurrences of the matching text with a string
or another pattern.  MightEMacs supports searching using regular expressions
(REs) or plain text patterns.  Additionally, either type of search can be case-
sensitive or case-insensitive, and searching can be done either forward or
backward.  The type of pattern matching is controlled by option characters
appended to the pattern string (explained below), and by two global modes:
"Exact" and "Regexp".  When enabled, the former mode specifies case-sensitive
pattern matching by default and the latter specifies RE matching by default.
Either or both can be enabled or disabled at any time.

A colon and one or more lowercase letters may be appended to any pattern to
specify options, as follows:

    ~be~B       Exact pattern matching.  Case of letters is significant.
    ~bi~B       Ignore case.  Case of letters is not significant.
    ~bp~B       Plain text matching.  The pattern is matched literally.
    ~br~B       Regexp matching.  The pattern is matched as a regular expression.
    ~bm~B       Multi-line mode.  When performing RE matching, the ~b.~B metacharacter
            and a negative character class ~b[^...]~B will match a ~unewline~U, which
            they do not by default (but only if, in the latter case, the
            character class does not contain a ~unewline~U).

Pattern options always override the corresponding global modes.  For example,
the pattern "abc.:ri" would be processed as a regular expression and case would
be ignored, whether or not the ~uExact~U or ~uRegexp~U global modes were enabled.
Whereas "abc.:e" would cause case to be significant, but would be processed as a
regular expression if ~uRegexp~U mode was enabled, and as plain text if not.  Also,
to allow a pattern option string to be part of a pattern and avoid ambiguity
when a pattern is interpreted, the following rule is used:

    "If a pattern ends with a colon followed by one or more valid option
    letters, and the colon is not the first character of the pattern, then
    everything preceding the colon is the pattern.  In all other cases, the
    entire string is the pattern (with no options)."

So for example, the pattern "abc:ri" would be interpreted as RE pattern /abc/i,
"abc:r:p" would be interpreted as plain text pattern 'abc:r', "abc::r" would be
interpreted as RE pattern /abc:/, and "abc:rx" would be interpreted as plain
text pattern 'abc:rx' (because it contains invalid option letter ~bx~B).

MightEMacs supports most of the regular expression pattern-matching
metacharacters, including grouping, and supports group references in replacement
patterns.  Regular expression syntax and use are explained in detail in Advanced
Help.  Simple searching and replacing using string patterns are explained here.

To search for a string pattern, use the "searchForw" (~uC-s~U) or "searchBack" (~uC-r~U)
command.  You will be prompted to enter the pattern.  (The pattern is delimited
by ~uESC~U by default so that ~uRTN~U can be entered as part of the pattern.  This can
be changed however, by setting the $searchDelim variable to ~uRTN~U or a different
delimiter key.)  Once a pattern has been set, the "huntForw" (~uC-]~U) and
"huntBack" (~uC-^~U) commands may be used in any combination to search for the next
occurrence going forward or backward.  The search pattern is saved in the
"search ring" and in the $searchPat variable.

To find and replace text, use the "replace" (~#uESC r~U) or "queryReplace" (~#uESC q~U)
command.  You will be prompted to enter the search and replacement patterns.  To
replace a fixed number of occurrences of a pattern, specify a numeric prefix to
either command.  For the "replace" command, the default action is to replace all
occurrences from the point to the end of the buffer.  The "queryReplace" command
works like "replace" but prompts for an action to take each time a match is
found, and also after the last match is found.  You can enter ~u?~U at the prompt to
get a list.  Actions include: skipping to the next occurrence, undoing the last
replacement and reprompting at that location, restarting from the beginning,
stopping and returning to the starting point, and replacing all remaining
matches without prompting.  In all cases, either command will stop if a match is
not found.  The replacement pattern is saved in the "replace ring" and in the
$replacePat variable.

The search and replace rings are explained in Advanced Help.
