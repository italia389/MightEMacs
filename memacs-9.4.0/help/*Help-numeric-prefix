~bNumeric Prefix~B

Much of the power of MightEMacs comes from the use of a "numeric prefix" with a
command, which is also referred to as the "n argument", mostly when writing
scripts.  A numeric prefix alters the default behavior of a command in some
manner, typically by specifying a direction (backward or forward) and/or a
quantity (a number of lines or repetitions, for example).

To illustrate this, let's do some navigation in this buffer.  Press ~#uESC f~U
(forwWord) and notice that the point moves one word forward.  Now press ~#uC-u ESC
f~U.  The point moves two words forward.  Try ~#uC-u 5 ESC f~U or ~#uC-u C-n~U and see what
happens.  You get the idea.  (Remember that ~uC-n~U is "forwLine" and ~uC-p~U is
"backLine".)

~uC-u~U provides (generally) a positive numeric prefix to a command and ~uC-_~U (~ucontrol~U
+ ~ushift~U + underscore) provides a negative one.

IMPORTANT NOTE: On most keyboards, you can generate the negative numeric prefix
by holding down the ~ucontrol~U key and pressing ~u-~U (dash) with or without the ~ushift~U
key.  Being that it is easier to type the key without holding down the ~ushift~U key
(~ucontrol~U + dash), we will show the key in that form from this point forward;
that is, we will use ~uC--~U instead of ~uC-_~U.  Just remember that the real ASCII
control key you are entering is ~ucontrol~U + _ (underscore).

The general way to enter a numeric prefix for a command (or macro) is to press
~uC-u~U and/or ~uC--~U one or more times before pressing the key(s) for the command.
The ~uC-u~U key is for positive, increasing values (in the sequence 2,0,3,4,5,...)
and the ~uC--~U key is for negative, decreasing values (in the sequence
-1,-2,-3,...).  You may also type digits directly, but only immediately after
the initial numeric prefix key.  Otherwise, the first digit typed will be taken
as a "command" and inserted into the text.  You may also cancel the operation at
any time by pressing ~uC-g~U (abort).

You may want to experiment with the numeric prefix keys now in combination with
some navigation keys (like the arrow keys).  It is important that you have a
good understanding of their use and purpose.  They are used extensively by the
editor.
