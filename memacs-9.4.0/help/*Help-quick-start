To edit a file, enter the filename as an argument when you start MightEMacs:

Alternatively, you can open a file to edit from within MightEMacs.  Type ~uC-x~U ~uC-f~U
(findFile), enter the filename at the prompt, and press ~ureturn~U.

    ~uC-f~U or ~uright-arrow~U      Move cursor right.
    ~uC-b~U or ~uleft-arrow~U       Move cursor left.
    ~uC-p~U or ~uup-arrow~U         Move cursor up.
    ~uC-n~U or ~udown-arrow~U       Move cursor down.
    ~uC-a~U                     Move to beginning of line.
    ~uC-e~U                     Move to end of line.
    ~uC-t~U                     Jump quickly left or right across line.

    ~uC-v~U                     Scroll down one page.
    ~uC-z~U                     Scroll up one page.
    ~#uESC <~U                   Move to beginning of buffer.
    ~#uESC >~U                   Move to end of buffer.

    ~uC-s~U                     Search forward (enter seach string and press ~uESC~U).
    ~uC-r~U                     Search backward (enter seach string and press ~uESC~U).
    ~uC-]~U                     Repeat last search forward.
    ~uC-^~U                     Repeat last search backward.

    ~uC-k~U                     Delete from cursor to end of line.
    ~uC-l~U                     Delete current line.

To perform an ~bapropos~B search on a command, function, macro, or variable name,
press ~#uESC a~U and enter part of a name; for example, "buf" or "file".

To exit MightEMacs:

    ~#uESC z~U                   Save changes and exit.
    ~#uESC e~U or ~#uC-x C-c~U        Exit without saving changes.
