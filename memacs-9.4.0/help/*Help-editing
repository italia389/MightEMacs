~bEssential Editing Commands~B

The ~bText Objects~B and ~bKill Ring~B sections explained what the various text objects
are, how they are delineated, and introduced the "kill ring", which is used for
saving and retrieving text.  Now we will explain what the primary commands are
that use text objects and the kill ring, and how to use them in an editing
session.  Once these commands are learned, you will be able to edit text quickly
and easily.

The commands that manipulate text objects do so in combination with a numeric
prefix.  They are invoked using the following sequence of keys:

     1. An optional numeric prefix.
     2. An optional copy, kill, or delete prefix key.
     3. A text object key.

The numeric prefix specifies a direction and quantity (with a default of one
item forward).

The prefix key specifies the type of operation:

    ~uC-c~U         for ~bcopy~B.
    ~uC-h~U         for ~bhomicide~B (kill).
    (No prefix) for ~bdelete~B.

And finally, the text object key specifies the type of object to operate on:

    ~uC-\~U         Word.
    ~uC-k~U         Partial line.
    ~uC-l~U         Line.
    ~uC-w~U         Region.
    ~u'~U           Fenced region (text between {}, (), [], or <> pairs,
                inclusive).

Copy and kill operations save the target text in the kill ring (for later
yanking); deletes do not.

So for example, the following key sequence would kill the current line and the
next line: ~#uC-u C-h C-l~U.  This translates to "for 2 items forward", "kill",
"line".  (Note that line operations always include an entire line plus the
delimiter, and the first line is always the current line.)  To ~bdelete~B two
lines forward instead, you would enter: ~#uC-u C-l~U.  Other examples:

    ~#uC-u 3 C-k~U           Delete text from the point up to, but not including the
                        third line break.

    ~#uC-- C-\~U             Delete previous word, including any non-word characters
                        between point and the word.

    ~#uC-- C-c C-\~U         Copy previous word (without moving the point).

    ~#uC-h '~U               Kill fenced region.  (Point must be positioned on a
                        ~u(~U, ~u)~U, ~u[~U, ~u]~U, ~u{~U, ~u}~U, ~u<~U, or ~u>~U character first).

    ~#uC-c C-w~U             Copy region (text from point to current position of mark
                        ' ').

    ~#uC-u C-u C-h C-k~U     Kill text from point to beginning of line (per zero
                        numeric prefix).

There is one exception to this rule: the "delFencedText" command, which is
~#uC-x '~U.  Being that the fenced region text object (an apostrophe) is a printable
character and would be inserted into the text if entered by itself, the ~uC-x~U
prefix (for ~bexterminate~B) is needed.

In summary, the commands that are used for text object operations are as
follows:

    ~#uC-c C-\~U     copyWord
    ~#uC-c C-k~U     copyToBreak
    ~#uC-c C-l~U     copyLine
    ~#uC-c C-w~U     copyRegion
    ~#uC-c '~U       copyFencedRegion

    ~#uC-h C-\~U     killWord
    ~#uC-h C-k~U     killToBreak
    ~#uC-h C-l~U     killLine
    ~#uC-h C-w~U     killRegion
    ~#uC-h '~U       killFencedRegion

    ~uC-\~U         delWord
    ~uC-k~U         delToBreak
    ~uC-l~U         delLine
    ~uC-w~U         delRegion
    ~#uC-x '~U       delFencedRegion

Note that even though delete commands do not save the target text in the kill
ring, the text ~bis~B saved on the "delete ring", and deleted text can always be
restored via the "undelete" (~#uESC u~U) and "undeleteCycle" (~#uESC U~U) commands.  This
is explained in detail in the next section, ~bUndeleting Text~B.

You are encouraged to practice copying, killing, and deleting text with the
commands listed above and yanking the text at various places in the buffer so
you get a good feel for how it is done (and commit the key bindings to memory).
These are core editing commands which are used frequently.
