~bUsing Color~B

As explained in the ~bTerminal Attributes~B help topic, MightEMacs provides the
ability to display text in bold, underlined, reverse video, or color (or any
combination of those attributes) in a window or on the message line by coding
terminal attribute specifications in the text.  Please refer to that section for
details.

In addition to displaying colored text in a window or on the message line, you
also have the ability to display mode lines in color and/or set colors for
informational displays generated by the ~ushow*~U commands.  This is done by using
the ~usetDispColor~U function to set the colors you want to use.  The function
sets the text and background colors of all informational displays, all mode
lines, and also the "keyboard macro recording indicator", which is displayed on
the mode line at the bottom-left corner of the screen when a keyboard macro is
being recorded.

The colors for each display item are set by calling ~usetDispColor~U with two
arguments: a keyword identifying the display item to be changed, and a color
pair, coded as a two-element array of integers.  (You do not have to define the
color pairs with ~usetColorPair~U beforehand, however.)  The possible keywords are
"Info" for informational displays, "ModeLine" for mode lines, and "Record" for
the keyboard macro recording indicator.  The color pair array (second argument)
may also be nil to set "no color".  Note that if your terminal supports color,
MightEMacs will set default colors for these display items (if possible) at
startup as follows: white on green for informational displays, white on brown
for mode lines, and white on red for the recording indicator.

For example, the following line of code would set mode line colors to white on
dark blue (and leave the informational display and recording indicator colors
unchanged):

    setDispColor 'ModeLine',[15,4]

This is typically done in the site startup file, /usr/local/lib/memacs/site.ms,
or the user startup file, ~~/.memacs.
