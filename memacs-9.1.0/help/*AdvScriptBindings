~bKey Binding Syntax~0

The ~ubinding~U function and the ~ubindKey~U and ~uunbindKey~U commands take a key binding
as their first argument.  Key bindings are specified in a coded string form as
one or two "key literals" separated by a space.  A key literal is defined as:

    Zero or more of the following with no intervening space:

        M-      Meta prefix key.
        C-      Control key.
        S-      Shift key.
        FN      Function key (including the arrow keys).

    which is followed by a printable character or character literal with no
    intervening space.  Character literals are any of the following in any case,
    although upper case is preferred:

        DEL     ~udelete~U key.
        ESC     ~uescape~U key.
        RTN     ~ureturn~U key.
        SPC     Spacebar.
        TAB     ~utab~U key.

    Additionally, "^~ux~U" may be substituted for "C-~ux~U" to specify a control
    character, although the latter syntax is preferred.  Some examples are:

        ~bKey(s)~0                          ~bCoded string form~0
        ~ucontrol~U + ~uf~U                     "C-f" (or "^F")

        ~uesc~U                             "ESC" (or "C-[")

        ~ureturn~U                          "RTN" (or "C-m" or "C-M")

        Right arrow                     "FNF"

        Shift left arrow                "S-FNB"

        ~ucontrol~U + ~ux~U followed by ~uk~U       "C-x k" (or "^x k")

        ~uesc~U followed by ~uesc~U             "M-ESC" (or "M-C-[" or "ESC ESC")

        The carat key ~u^~U                 "^"

        ~ucontrol~U + ~uh~U followed
        by carat ~u^~U                      "C-h ^" (or "^H ^")

        ~ucontrol~U + carat                 "C-^" (or "^^")

        ~ucontrol~U + ~uspacebar~U
        (null character)                "C-SPC" (or "C-@" or "^@")

        ~udelete~U key                      "DEL" (or "C-?" or "^?")

        ~uesc~U followed by
        ~ucontrol~U + space                 "M-C-SPC" (or "ESC C-SPC" or
                                        "^[ ^SPC")

        ~uesc~U followed by space           "M-SPC" (or "ESC SPC")

        The letter ~uQ~U (upper case)       "Q" (or "S-q" or "S-Q")

Coded bindings are not case-sensitive, with the exception of a single-letter
binding (like "f") or a key sequence where the second key is a letter (like
"C-c f"), which are.  Consequently, "C-h F" is the same key sequence as
"c-H s-f", but "x" is different than "X".  Also, raw 7-bit characters greater
than zero may be specified for any control character and the delete key, so the
pairs "C-a" and "\1", "C-m" and "\r", and "DEL" and "\x7f" are the same.
