~bEditing Multiple Files~0

Multiple files can be edited in a couple of ways.  One way is to simply specify
more than one file when invoking the editor.  For example, you could type the
following at a shell prompt:

    $ mm Notes.txt myscript.mm

As usual, a full-screen window will open displaying the first portion of the
first file; for example:

     ~u                                                                     ~U
    | ~u ~U1. Note one.                                                       |
    |  2. And this would be note number two.                              |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |~r== (Exact) == Notes == File: Notes.txt ============ MightEMacs 9.1.0 ~0|

A buffer for the second file will be created also, but it will be in the
background.  To bring it to the foreground, you typically would type ~#uC-x ]~U
(~unextBuf~U) or ~#uC-x [~U (~uprevBuf~U).  When you do this, the file will be read at the
same time.  (To save time and conserve memory, MightEMacs delays reading a file
if possible, until its buffer is selected.)

To see all the buffers that have been created in your editing session, you use
the ~ushowBuffers~U (~#uC-h b~U) command, which displays their names in a pop-up window.
For example, you would see something like the following in our example session:

     ~u                                                                     ~U
    | ~bACHMPNT    Size       Buffer               File~0                     |
    | ------- --------- -------------------- ---------------------------- |
    | :            6940 myscript             myscript.mm                  |
    | :            1286 Notes                Notes.txt                    |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |                                                                     |
    |~r== (Exact) == Notes == File: Notes.txt ============ MightEMacs 9.1.0 ~0|
    | End: ~b_~0                                                              |
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

You could try this yourself now.  Type ~#uC-h b~U.  You will see a list of all
visible buffers (if any) shown in alphabetical order.  Note that this help
buffer will not be shown in the list because it is hidden.  To include hidden
buffers, use a numeric prefix of -1.  Type ~#uC-_ C-h b~U.  You will now see
buffer(s) whose names begin with "*Help-".  Press ~uq~U or ~uESC~U to get back to the
edit window.

Continuing with our example editing session, you would be viewing one of the
buffers ("Notes" or "myscript") at this point and could edit it.  Recall that
you can always see which buffer you are in by looking at the mode line at the
bottom of the window.  The buffer name and filename (if any) are at the end of
the line.  As explained previously, you can switch to the next or previous
buffer at any time by typing ~#uC-x ]~U or ~#uC-x [~U, which would put the current buffer
into the background and bring the next or previous buffer into the current
window (the foreground).  You can also select a buffer directly by name.  To do
this, type ~#uC-x b~U (~uselectBuf~U) and enter the name of the buffer at the prompt.

Now let's say you wanted to rename the "myscript.mm" file to "myscript2.mm", or
more precisely, you wanted to write its buffer to a different file.  To do this,
you use the ~usetBufFile~U (~#uC-x F~U) command to change the buffer's filename before
you save the buffer to disk.  The steps would be:

    1.  Switch to the "myscript" buffer.
    2.  Type ~#uC-x F~U and enter "myscript2.mm" at the prompt (and notice that the
        buffer name is changed to match the filename).
    3.  Type ~#uC-x C-s~U to save the buffer to the new file.  If the file already
        exists, it will be overwritten.

Note that the ~usaveFile~U command will not do anything if the buffer you are saving
is not changed.  You can change its state by editing the buffer or by using the
~ualterBufAttr~U (~#uC-x a~U) command.

When you are working on multiple buffers, it is possible to save the changes in
all buffers at once by specifying a positive numeric prefix to the ~usaveFile~U
command.  You would enter ~#uC-u C-x C-s~U to do this, which instructs the editor to
scan the buffer list for changed buffers.  For each one that is found, the
buffer is saved to disk and the name is displayed briefly on the message line.

Let's say you wanted to open one more file in this editing session for output:
"src/main.c".  However, the "src" directory does not exist so we'll have to
create it first.  To do that, we can use the ~ushellCmd~U command.  You would press
~#uC-x !~U and the following would be displayed:

    |~r== (Exact) == Notes == File: Notes.txt ============ MightEMacs 9.1.0 ~0|
    | > ~b_~0                                                                 |
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

At the "> " prompt, you would type the "mkdir src" shell command and hit ~ureturn~U,
then press any key to dismiss the "[End]" prompt.

Now we're ready to open our C file, which is done with the ~ufindFile~U command.
You would type ~#uC-x C-f~U and at the prompt, enter "src/main.c":

    |~r== (Exact) == Notes == File: Notes.txt ============ MightEMacs 9.1.0 ~0|
    | Find file: src/main.c~b_~0                                              |
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

MightEMacs would create a new empty buffer for the file and switch to it in the
current window.  Note that the file would not yet be created on disk (and if you
exited the editor at this point without making any changes to the buffer, it
wouldn't be).  Additionally, the mode line would show the "C" buffer mode, which
enables automatic indentation and fence matching as you type your C code:

    |~r== (Exact) [C] == main == File: src/main.c ======== MightEMacs 9.1.0 ~0|
    |                                                                     |
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, you could use the ~uquickExit~U (~#uESC z~U) command again when you finished
editing all your files.  Recall that this command saves all changed buffers to
disk and displays the pathnames as you return to the shell.  You would see the
following upon exit from our example session:

    Saved file "Notes.txt"
    Saved file "src/main.c"
    $

Note that MightEMacs can edit text files containing ~uCR-LF~U, ~uCR~U, or ~uNL~U line
delimiters.  The line delimiter is determined automatically (by default) when a
file is read.  However, regardless of which delimiter(s) a file contains, all
lines in a buffer are assumed to end with ~uNL~U.  MightEMacs remembers the real
line delimiter for each buffer and writes it back to disk at the end of each
line when a file is saved.  The output delimiter can be changed however, by
setting the $otpDelim system variable.  Additionally, the input delimiter(s) can
be forced to be a certain value by setting the $inpDelim system variable.
