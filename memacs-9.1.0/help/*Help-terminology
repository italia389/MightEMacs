~bDisplay Terminology~0

A few terms were introduced in the previous sections which have not been fully
explained, so let's do that now.  In MightEMacs, the entire terminal screen
(usually a GUI window) is called the ~bscreen~0.  A screen contains one or more
~bwindows~0 which are created by splitting the screen vertically, into a top window
and a bottom window.  This can be done multiple times to create additional
windows.  It is also possible to create multiple screens; however, all screens
are stacked on top of (overlay) each other so that only the frontmost one is
visible at any time.  Lastly, a screen remembers the directory it was created in
and will automatically switch back to it if needed whenever the screen is
selected.

Windows display ~bbuffers~0, which are containers that hold the text you are
editing.  Buffers are usually associated with files, but this is not required.
Multiple buffers may (and usually do) exist at the same time, some displayed in
windows and some in the background.  You switch to a buffer in a window in order
to view or edit it.  You can also display the same buffer in multiple windows,
each with it's own "cursor" position.

Finally, every window (on every screen) maintains a current buffer position,
which is where the cursor is when that window is the current window.  This
position is referred to as the ~bpoint~0.  The point is saved with the buffer when a
buffer is put into the background, and restored again when it is redisplayed in
a window.  Points also exist independently in windows; that is, if one buffer is
being displayed in multiple windows, each window will maintain it's own point
for that buffer.  So in summary, the cursor on the screen is simply where the
point is for the buffer in the current window.  We will refer to the "point"
hereafter in these Help pages when referring to the current place in the text
where editing operations will occur.


~bCommand Terminology~0

In addition to different kinds of display elements, there are different kinds of
"operatives" in MightEMacs which you should be aware of.  A ~bcommand~0 is the
primary one.  It is built-in, can be bound to a key (or key sequence), and can
be run interactively or in a script.  A ~bmacro~0 has the same properties, but can
be written in a script; hence, is a "custom command" that you can create
yourself.  A ~bfunction~0 is a built-in operative that cannot be bound or run
interactively, and is intended for script use only.  Lastly, an ~balias~0 is another
name that can be created for a command, function, or macro, however it cannot
be bound.  (An example of the last operative is ~urequire~U, which is a built-in
alias for the ~uxeqFile~U command.)
