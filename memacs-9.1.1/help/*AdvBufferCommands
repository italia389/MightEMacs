~bBuffer Commands~0

As explained in the ~bDisplay Terminology~0 section, all editing of text occurs in a
buffer.  A buffer may or may not be attached to a file.  If it is, the filename
will be shown in the mode line of the window displaying the buffer.  The
filename is completely independent of the buffer.  It may be changed at any time
or deleted.  It really only comes into play when an I/O operation is performed
on the buffer, at which point it must exist and be valid for the I/O operation
to complete successfully.  As you may have guessed, MightEMacs opens a file,
performs I/O, and closes the file at the moment a file command is executed.  The
file is not opened until then and is closed immediately afterward.

The ~usetBufFile~U (~#uC-x F~U) command is used to associate a filename with a buffer.
When invoking the command, if you clear the line and press ~ureturn~U, or press
~uC-SPC~U at the prompt, the filename will be deleted.

MightEMacs provides several other commands for working with buffers, which you
may want to try out.  See the ~ushowCommands~U (~#uC-h c~U) display for details.
Following is a summary of the buffer commands which are used most often and also
those that are not discussed on other help pages:

    ~ualterBufAttr~U    ~#uC-x a~U       Clear or set user-modifiable attributes of a
                                buffer: "Changed", "Hidden", and "TermAttr".
                                (All other attributes are maintained by the
                                editor and cannot be modified.)
    ~uclearBuf~U        ~#uC-x DEL~U     Delete all text from a buffer and clear the
                                "Changed" buffer attribute.
    ~udeleteBuf~U       ~#uC-x C-b~U     Delete a named buffer or buffers which meet
                                certain criteria if a numeric prefix is given.
    ~uinsertBuf~U       ~#uC-x ^~U       Insert a named buffer into the current buffer at
                                point.
    ~ulastBuf~U         ~#uC-x \~U       Switch back to last buffer exited from.  If the
                                numeric prefix is negative, the current buffer
                                is deleted after the switch.
    ~unextBuf~U         ~#uC-x ]~U       Switch to the next (alphabetically higher)
                                buffer n times.  If the numeric prefix is
                                negative, the current buffer is deleted after
                                the switch.
    ~uprevBuf~U         ~#uC-x [~U       Switch to the previous (alphabetically lower)
                                buffer n times.  If the numeric prefix is
                                negative, the current buffer is deleted after
                                the switch.
    ~urenameBuf~U       ~#uC-x B~U       Rename a buffer.
    ~uscratchBuf~U      ~#uC-x #~U       Create a "scratch" buffer with a unique name and
                                switch to it.
    ~uselectBuf~U       ~#uC-x b~U       Switch to a named buffer in the current window.
                                The selected buffer can be "rendered" in various
                                other ways if a numeric prefix is given.
    ~utruncBuf~U        ~#uESC t~U       Truncate current buffer; that is, delete all
                                text from the point to the beginning or end of
                                the buffer.
    ~uxeqBuf~U          ~#uC-x x~U       Execute a named buffer as a macro.

There are two other buffer commands worth mentioning: ~unarrowBuf~U (~#uC-x <~U) and
~uwidenBuf~U (~#uC-x >~U).  The ~unarrowBuf~U command temporarily shrinks the current buffer
to a block of contiguous lines, which is determined by the numeric prefix.  When
buffer "narrowing" is in effect, a "<" character is displayed in the first
column of the mode line.  Narrowing a buffer can be useful for performing
editing operations on a portion of it without affecting the excluded text; for
example, when doing a search and replace, or running a keyboard macro repeatedly
until the "end" of the buffer is reached.  A buffer can remain narrowed for as
long as you like and edited normally, although you will not be able to access
any of the hidden lines or marks while it is narrowed.  To restore it (keeping
any changes that were made), enter ~#uC-x >~U.

Note that you will be warned if you attempt to save a narrowed buffer to disk.
If you choose to proceed, the narrowed portion (only) will be written, the
hidden portion will be permanently discarded, and the buffer will no longer be
in a narrowed state.  This can happen unexpectedly if the "ASave" global mode is
enabled.  To cancel the save, simply press ~ureturn~U or enter ~un~U (the default) at
the prompt.
