Welcome to the MightEMacs Help System.  Topics are listed below.  To get help on
a particular topic, move the cursor to the link at the beginning of the topic
line and press ~#uC-h C-h~U.  Links are words in angle brackets, like this: <keys>
The cursor may be on any character in the link.

~uC-h~U means "control h"; that is, hold down the ~ucontrol~U key and press the ~uh~U key.
Therefore, you would hold down ~ucontrol~U and press ~uh~U twice for ~#uC-h C-h~U, which will
go to the topic associated with the link the cursor is on.  Standard links on
every help page are:

<home>              Go to home page (this page).
<exit>              Exit the Help System and return to editing session.

To exit MightEMacs at any time, press ~#uC-x C-c~U or ~#uESC e~U.
