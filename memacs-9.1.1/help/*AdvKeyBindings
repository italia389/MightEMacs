~bBinding and Unbinding Keys~0

As was discussed previously in the ~bKeys and Key Bindings~0 section, any key or key
sequence can be bound to a command or macro (or more precisely, a non-
constrained macro), including the printable characters like letters (each of
which are bound separately by case), digits, and punctuation characters.  And
when you type a key or key sequence, the command or macro that it is bound to is
executed.  By default, the printable keys (except the spacebar) are bound to the
"self insert" pseudo-command and thus, insert one copy of themselves into the
text when typed.  Non-printable keys and key sequences however, have no default
action and will generate an error if typed when not bound to anything.
Additionally, if an executed key or key sequence returns a Boolean ~ufalse~U
value, any running keyboard macro is stopped and "False return" is displayed on
the message line.  (Keyboard macros are discussed in the ~bKeyboard Macros~0
section.)

Generally, all key bindings used during an editing session are either built-in
or are set in startup macros.  You can change them interactively, however.  To
create a key binding, enter:

    ~#uESC k~U       ~#ubindKey~U

You will be prompted for the key sequence and command or macro name to bind it
to.  To delete a key binding, enter:

    ~#uESC C-k~U     ~#uunbindKey~U

You will be prompted for the key sequence to unbind.  To bind or unbind a single
key, use a numeric prefix that is negative or zero.

Recall that the ~#uC-h c~U (~#ushowCommands~U) and ~#uC-h @~U (~#ushowMacros~U) commands display all
commands and macros and their key bindings.  Also, ~ushowKey~U (~#uC-h ?~U) shows what a
particular key sequence is bound to and ~ushowBindings~U (~#uC-h n~U) shows all possible
key bindings (or just those matching an apropos pattern) and what they are bound
to.

See the ~bKey Binding Syntax~0 section for the use and syntax of key bindings in
coded string form (for use in a script).
