~bModes and Mode Groups~0

MightEMacs uses "modes" to activate and deactivate features during the editing
session.  There are two types: ~bglobal~0 and ~bbuffer~0.  Global modes apply to all
buffers, whereas buffer modes (as the name implies) apply only to the buffer in
which they are activated.  Buffer modes are displayed on the mode line of each
window, whereas global modes are displayed only on the mode line of the window
at the bottom of the screen.  Global modes are in parentheses "()" and buffer
modes are in brackets "[]".  Additionally, it is possible to activate a mode but
not display it.  This is controlled by mode attributes.

The editor has several global and buffer modes which are built-in.  Modes may
also be created however, at any time.  These are called ~buser~0 modes.  User modes
can be deleted, but built-in modes cannot.

All modes, whether built-in or user-created, have attributes (or properties)
which are set when the mode is created.  They can also be changed later, with
some exceptions.  Attributes include the mode type, and whether it is visible or
hidden.  Modes are created, deleted, and edited with the ~ueditMode~U (~#uC-c m~U)
command.

Sometimes it is desirable to prevent more than one mode of the same kind from
being enabled at the same time; for example, a buffer mode like "Ruby" or "C"
for a programming language.  This is accomplished by using a ~bmode group~0.  Mode
groups may contain zero or more modes.  All modes in a group must be of the same
type (global or buffer), and are mutually exclusive (only one may be enabled at
a given time).  And like modes, mode groups can be built-in or user defined and
have attributes.  They are created, deleted, and edited with the ~ueditModeGroup~U
(~#uC-c g~U) command.

To see all available modes and mode groups, use the ~ushowModes~U (~#uC-h m~U) command,
which will display all global and buffer mode names, group names, their current
statuses, and a brief description of each in a pop-up window.  (Modes and mode
groups are described in detail in Advanced Help.)

Modes are activated, toggled, deactivated, or cleared with these two commands:

    ~uchgGlobalMode~U         ~#uESC m~U
    ~uchgBufMode~U            ~#uC-x m~U

Each command will prompt for a mode name (and buffer name, if applicable), then
deactivate the mode (n < 0), toggle it (n == 0, default), activate it (n == 1),
or clear all modes first, then activate it (n > 1).  Auto-completion is
supported, so you may enter a partial name (ignoring case) and press ~utab~U to
complete the name and select it.  For example, "rd" may be entered followed by a
tab to select the "RdOnly" buffer mode.
