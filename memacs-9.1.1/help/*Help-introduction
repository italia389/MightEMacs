~bIntroduction~0

MightEMacs is started from the shell by typing the ~bmm~0 or ~bmemacs~0 command.  You
may optionally specify one or more files to edit.  If a file is given, it is
read into a "buffer" and displayed in a full-screen window, ready for you to
begin editing it.  If the file does not exist, the window will be blank
(allowing you to create a new file).  If a file is not specified, a new buffer
called "untitled" is created with no associated filename.

The line displayed in reverse video at the bottom of the screen is the "mode
line".  It contains basic information about the editing session.  For example,
let's say you typed:

    $ mm myscript.mm

to start MightEMacs.  The mode line would then look something like this:

  ~r== (Exact) [Memacs] == myscript == File: myscript.mm === MightEMacs 9.1.0 ~0

This says that global mode "Exact" and buffer mode "Memacs" are enabled, the
buffer name is "myscript" (derived from the filename), the file pathname is
"myscript.mm", and we are running version 9.1.0 of the editor.  Global modes are
shown in parentheses and buffer modes in brackets.

If you typed some text into the buffer, you would notice that an asterisk
appears at the beginning of the mode line in the second column.  This is an
indicator that the buffer has been modified.  To move the cursor around, you can
use the arrow keys or press ~uC-f~U (~uforwChar~U), ~uC-b~U (~ubackChar~U), ~uC-p~U (~uprevline~U),
or ~uC-n~U (~unextline~U).  You can also jump to the end of a line (~uC-e~U), the beginning
(~uC-a~U), traverse a line quickly in either direction (press ~uC-t~U repeatedly), move
forward a page (~uC-v~U), back a page (~uC-z~U), jump to the beginning of the buffer
(~#uESC <~U), or to the end (~#uESC >~U).

The key description ~uC-b~U means ~ucontrol~U + ~ub~U; that is, hold the ~ucontrol~U key down
and press the ~ub~U key.  On the other hand, ~#uESC <~U means press the ~uesc~U key, let go,
then press the ~u<~U key (two separate keystrokes).  Additionally, a capitalized
word may be used for a key, as follows:

    DEL     ~udelete~U key.
    ESC     ~uescape~U key.
    RTN     ~ureturn~U key.
    SPC     Spacebar.
    TAB     ~utab~U key.

Lastly, ~uS-TAB~U means hold down the ~ushift~U key and press the ~utab~U key.

Note that you can type ~uC-v~U and ~uC-z~U to scroll forward and backward through this
page and other help pages.

Note also that a key is usually shown in the Help System with a command name
following it, such as ~uC-f~U (~uforwChar~U).  This indicates (in this example) that the
~uC-f~U key is "bound" to the ~uforwChar~U command and the command is what is executed
when the key is pressed.  Key bindings and commands are explained in more detail
in the next section.

Now back to our editing session.  If we were done editing our file (assuming the
editor was started with a file argument), the obvious next steps would be to
save the buffer to disk and exit.  To save the buffer, you would press ~#uC-x C-s~U
(~usaveFile~U).  The asterisk in the mode line will change back to "=" and you
will get some feedback on the "message line" at the bottom of the screen that
the buffer was written to disk.

Let's say you needed to make a few more changes first.  When you were done (and
the buffer was modified again), you could save the buffer as before by pressing
~#uC-x C-s~U and then exit MightEMacs by pressing ~#uC-x C-c~U (~uexit~U).  However, you can
do this in one step instead.  You would press ~#uESC z~U (~uquickExit~U).  The file is
saved and you're back to the shell.
