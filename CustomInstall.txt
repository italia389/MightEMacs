Advanced Installation Instructions for MightEMacs

This distribution includes standard installer packages for the macOS platform
and Linux platforms (CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).
If you are installing on one of these platforms, have superuser (root)
privileges, do not want to install MightEMacs in your HOME directory, and do not
want to customize the installation process, please refer to file Install.txt for
instructions on using the standard installers.

Make files for macOS and Linux platforms are included in this distribution.
Compilation on other Unix platforms should be possible as well, however it has
not been tested, so there may be errors.  If this occurs, please contact the
author with the details so that the problem can be resolved.  (See the ReadMe.md
file for contact information.)  Note that if you are installing on a macOS
system, Xcode must already be installed (vers. 7.2.1 or later recommended) so
that command-line tools are available.

To install MightEMacs with optional customizations, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this CustomInstall.txt file:

	$ cd MightEMacs-master

 2. The CXL and XRE libraries are required to compile and link MightEMacs.  You
    will need to download these from GitHub and build and install them before
    proceeding.  They can be obtained with these links:

	https://github.com/italia389/CXL.git
	https://github.com/italia389/XRE.git

    Please refer to the CustomInstall.txt file in each package for instructions
    on how to build and install the libraries on your platform (in your HOME
    directory, for example).  You will provide the paths to the installation
    directory of each library in step 6.  Note that the XRE library should be
    built in 8-bit ASCII character mode (without wide character and multibyte
    character support) for linking with the MightEMacs object files.

 3. Remove any existing package binaries:

	$ make clean

 4. Review and/or edit the beginning portion of include/std.h to customize
    MightEMacs compilation (optional).

 5. Review and/or edit include/bind.h if you want to change the default key
    bindings (not recommended).

 6. Build MightEMacs.  This will create link file "mm" in the current directory.
    Note that during compilation you may see warnings about uninitialized
    variables, signed/unsigned comparisons, or other messages with some
    compilers.  These may be ignored.

    To proceed, supply the paths to the CXL and XRE installation directories as
    values of the CXL and XRE variables.  For example, on Linux with CXL
    installed in the HOME directory and XRE installed in /usr/local:

	$ make CXL=$HOME/cxlib XRE=/usr/local

 7. Install MightEMacs.  If you have customized file "site.ms" (site-wide
    defaults) from a previous installation and want to save your changes, copy
    the file to another directory now.  For example, to copy the file to your
    home directory (assuming MightEMacs was previously installed in /usr/local):

	$ cp /usr/local/lib/memacs/site.ms ~

 8. If you have superuser privileges and want to do a site-wide install, go to
    the next step; otherwise, go to step 12.

 9. Perform a site-wide install:

	$ su root
	# make install
	# exit

10. Make sure directory /usr/local/bin is in your shell PATH so that the shell
    can find the MightEMacs binary.  Display it with the following command:

	$ echo $PATH

    If you need to add it, modify the site startup file for the shell that you
    are using.  For example, add the following line to file /etc/profile for the
    Bourne shell (bash) or file /etc/zshenv for zsh:

	export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

    To determine your shell, enter the following command:

	$ echo $0

    MightEMacs looks for its startup files in the current directory and
    directory /usr/local/share/memacs/scripts by default.  If you want to create
    your own scripts in another directory (for example, "$HOME/scripts"), you
    can include it in the MSPATH environmental variable so that MightEMacs will
    search that directory also.  To accomplish this, add this line to the
    startup file you modified above:

	export MSPATH=":/usr/local/share/memacs/scripts:$HOME/scripts"

11. Go to step 14.

12. Perform a local (user) install.  Supply the pathname of the local
    installation directory with the INSTALL variable; for example,
    "$HOME/MightEMacs":

	$ make install INSTALL=$HOME/MightEMacs

13. Modify your shell startup file in your HOME directory so that the shell can
    find the MightEMacs binary and MightEMacs can find its startup files.  For
    example, add the following two lines to file ~/.profile if you are using the
    Bourne shell (bash) or to file ~/.zshenv if you are using zsh:

	export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/MightEMacs/bin"
	export MSPATH=":$HOME/MightEMacs/share/memacs/scripts"

14. If you want to install the sample user startup file (.memacs) into your HOME
    directory (and rename any existing file to ".memacs.old"):

	$ make user-install

15. Review and/or edit file "site.ms" in the .../share/memacs/scripts
    installation directory to customize site-wide defaults for the editor, such
    as scrolling options, the search string delimiter, etc.  If you saved an old
    version of the file in step 7, you may have to change settings in the new
    "site.ms" file to match the old settings because some of the syntax may have
    changed, depending on the previous version of MightEMacs you were using.

Note that MightEMacs can be run with the command "memacs" or "mm" with optional
switches and/or arguments.  See memacs(1) for details.
