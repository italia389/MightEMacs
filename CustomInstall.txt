Advanced Installation Instructions for MightEMacs

This distribution includes standard installer packages for the macOS platform
and Linux platforms (CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).
If you are installing on one of these platforms, have superuser (root)
privileges, do not want to install MightEMacs in your HOME directory, and do not
want to customize the installation process, please refer to file Install.txt for
instructions on using the standard installers.

64-bit binaries and make files for macOS and Linux platforms are included in
this distribution.  If you are not installing on a macOS or GNU/Linux platform,
the installation scripts will automatically select and use the appropriate make
files from the included platforms for compilation.  However, compilation on
other platforms has not been tested, so it is possible that there may be errors.
If this occurs, please contact the author with the details so that the problem
can be resolved.  (See the ReadMe.md file for contact information.)  For
reference, make file locations are (for example, Linux):

	prolib-A.B.C/linux/Makefile
	memacs-X.Y.Z/linux/Makefile

To install MightEMacs with optional customizations, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this CustomInstall.txt file:

	$ cd MightEMacs-master

 2. MightEMacs 64-bit binaries are included for GNU/Linux (built on a CentOS
    vers. 6 machine) and macOS vers. 10.10 (Yosemite) and later.  If you want to
    use one of these binaries and skip compilation, go to step 7; otherwise, go
    to the next step.  Note that if you are installing on a macOS system, Xcode
    must already be installed (vers. 7.2.1 or later recommended) so that
    command-line tools are available.

 3. Remove package binaries:

	$ make clean

 4. Review and/or edit beginning portion of memacs-X.Y.Z/src/std.h to customize
    MightEMacs compilation (optional).

 5. Review and/or edit memacs-X.Y.Z/src/bind.h if you want to change the default
    key bindings (not recommended).

 6. To see a list of available platforms (optional):

	$ make

 7. Build and/or link MightEMacs.  This will create files "libpro.a" in the
    prolib directory and "mm" in the memacs directory.  Note that if you are
    compiling the sources, you may see several "... may be used uninitialized
    ..." or other warnings with some compilers.  These may be ignored.

    To proceed, supply the desired platform name in lower case as the value of
    the PLATFORM variable; for example, Linux:

	$ make PLATFORM=linux

 8. Install MightEMacs.  If you have customized file "site.ms" (site-wide
    defaults) from a previous installation and want to save your changes, copy
    the file to another directory now.  For example, to copy the file to your
    home directory (assuming MightEMacs was previously installed in /usr/local):

	$ cp /usr/local/lib/memacs/site.ms ~

 9. If you have superuser privileges and want to do a site-wide install, go to
    the next step; otherwise, go to step 13.

10. Perform a site-wide install:

	$ su root
	# make install
	# exit

11. Make sure directory /usr/local/bin is in your shell PATH so that the shell
    can find the MightEMacs binary.  Display it with the following command:

	$ echo $PATH

    If you need to add it, modify the site startup file for the shell that you
    are using.  For example, add the following line to file /etc/profile for the
    Bourne shell (bash) or file /etc/zshenv for zsh:

	export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

    To determine your shell, enter the following command:

	$ echo $0

    MightEMacs looks for its startup files in directory /usr/local/lib/memacs by
    default.  If you want to create your own scripts in another directory (for
    example, "$HOME/scripts"), you can include it in the MMPATH environmental
    variable so that MightEMacs will search that directory also.  To accomplish
    this, add this line to the startup file you modified above:

	export MMPATH=":/usr/local/lib/memacs:$HOME/scripts"

12. Go to step 15.

13. Perform a local (user) install.  Supply the pathname of the local
    installation directory as the value of the INSTALL variable; for example,
    "$HOME/MightEMacs":

	$ make install INSTALL=$HOME/MightEMacs

14. Modify your shell startup file in your HOME directory so that the shell can
    find the MightEMacs binary and MightEMacs can find its startup files.  For
    example, add the following two lines to file ~/.profile if you are using the
    Bourne shell (bash) or to file ~/.zshenv if you are using zsh:

	export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/MightEMacs/bin"
	export MMPATH=":$HOME/MightEMacs/lib/memacs"

15. If you want to install the sample user startup file (.memacs) into your HOME
    directory (and rename any existing file to ".memacs.old"):

	$ make user-install

16. Review and/or edit file "site.ms" in the .../lib/memacs installation
    directory to customize site-wide defaults for the editor, such as scrolling
    options, the search string delimiter, etc.  If you saved an old version of
    the file in step 8, you may have to change settings in the new "site.ms"
    file to match the old settings because some of the syntax may have changed,
    depending on the previous version of MightEMacs you were using.

Note that MightEMacs can be run with the command "memacs" or "mm" with optional
switches and/or arguments.  See memacs(1) for details.
