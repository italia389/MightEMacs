MightEMacs RELEASE HISTORY

----------
9.5.0	1 Sep 2020

 1. Changed switch processing:
	- modified -path switch to replace existing search path with specified
	  list if it begins with a circumflex (^) instead of prepending it (the
	  default).
	- renamed -N (-no-read) switch to -R.
	- created -N (-no-user-startup) switch, which prevents the user startup
	  file (~/.memacs) from being loaded.
 2. Changed regular expression engine:
	- replaced built-in regular expression functions to equivalent calls to
	  the (external) XRE library.
	- changed "match" function to allow numeric argument (N) to be any
	  non-negative value (instead of only 0-9, as previously), but return
	  nil if N specifies a captured group that does not exist.
    Now additional regular expression functionality is available, most notably
    the "or" metacharacter '|', group iteration (e.g., "(abc)+"), and back
    references.
 3. Added fuzzy matching:
	- created 'f' search pattern option, which enables approximate matching
	  on the pattern using default parameters set by the XRE xregainit()
	  function.
	- changed processing of search pattern options so that the 'r' option is
	  assumed if 'm' or 'f' is specified (so that 'm' and 'f' are allowed
	  shorthand for 'mr' and 'fr').
 4. Added ability to use "\0" and escaped characters (like "\n") in a
    replacement pattern for a plain text search and eliminated "&" (for the
    matched string), which was unusual and non-standard.  Now standard
    metacharacters will always be recognized in a replacement pattern for the
    "queryReplace" (ESC q) and "replace" (ESC r) commands and the "sub"
    function, whether or not the search pattern is a regular expression.
 5. Added explanation of pattern options to help text for "SearchForw" and
    "SearchBack" commands.
 6. Changed "replace" and "queryReplace" commands to return Boolean result when
    run interactively as well as in script mode for consistency, and so that a
    key macro will terminate if the command fails.
 7. Changed "queryReplace" command to do final replacement and stop if response
    is 'Y', instead of issuing final action prompt, as previously.
 8. Improved "delBuf" command:
	- changed to allow deletion of a buffer that is being displayed, instead
	  of returning an error, as previously.
	- added "Displayed" option to include buffers being displayed when
	  multiple buffers are deleted.
	- renamed option "AllVisible" to "Visible" to be consistent with other
	  commands.
    Now the "delBuf" command allows any displayed buffer to be deleted,
    including the current one, as long as at least one other "regular" buffer
    exists that can be switched to.
 9. Redesigned how directories are managed and associated with buffers:
	- when a buffer is created, the current screen's directory is now
	  remembered as the buffer's "home" directory.
	- changed processing so that an error is returned if the home directory
	  of a buffer being activated does not match the current screen's
	  directory (which will prevent an accidental read of a file on the
	  command line from the wrong directory).
	- changed "saveFile" command to:
		. save a changed buffer if it is in the background and its home
		  directory is set; otherwise, return an error.
		. prompt for confirmation if a changed buffer is in the
		  foreground and its home directory is different than the
		  directory of the screen it is being displayed on.
    This fixes a problem where a file could have been saved to the wrong
    directory when multiple screens existed in different directories.  Now the
    last screen a buffer was displayed on has no effect on where it is saved,
    and the directory a buffer is saved to is much more rigidly controlled and
    scrutinized to prevent an unintentional save to the wrong place.
10. Changed "prevBuf" and "nextBuf" commands to switch once and limit selection
    to buffers having same home directory as current screen if n == 0 (instead
    of including hidden buffers in selection, as previously).
11. Changed macro definition and use in scripts:
	- eliminated "constrain" macro modifier.
	- replaced "macro" reserved word with "command" and "function", and
	  "endmacro" with "endroutine" so that user routines can be defined
	  either as a command or function (in the same manner as built-in
	  "system" commands and functions).
	- changed "usage" and "desc" labels in user routine header to
	  "arguments" and "description", which are more accurate.
	- replaced "Macro" attribute and option in "bufAttr?" and "bufInfo"
	  functions with "Command" and "Function".
	- changed "showBuffers" command to display "command" or "function"
	  buffer flag instead of "macro" flag, and to not display "constrained"
	  flag (which no longer exists).
	- changed "setHook" command to:
		. require that a hook be set to a user function or the
		  "wrapWord" system function instead of a constrained macro.
		. require that the function's expected argument count(s) match
		  the hook's argument count.
	- set "wrap" hook internally to "wrapWord" system function.
	- replaced "delMacro" (C-x @) command with "delRoutine" (C-x U), which
	  deletes user command(s) and function(s).
	- changed "defined?" function to return:
		. "user command" or "user function" for a user-defined command
		  or function instead of "macro".
		. "system command" or "system function" for a system-defined
		  command or function.
		. "pseudo command" instead of "pseudo-command" for consistency.
	- changed "apropos", "showCommands", and "showFunctions" commands to:
		. display user commands and functions in their own sections
		  following their system counterparts.
		. accept "System" and/or "User" keyword options if n argument to
		  select which command/function report section(s) to display or
		  search.
	- changed "apropos" and "showFunctions" commands to:
		. display user functions by default only if they have help text
		  or are bound to a hook (whether or not an apropos string has
		  been specified).
		. accept "All" keyword option if n argument to include functions
		  with no help text.
	- renamed $maxMacroDepth system variable to $maxCallDepth.
    Now user routines are coded as either a "command" or "function" in MScript,
    any user function and the "wrapWord" system function can be bound to a hook
    as long as its argument counts match that of the hook, and user functions
    are displayed in the "showFunctions" listing by default if they have help
    text (instead of non-constrained macros, as previously).
12. Renamed all "*KeyMacro" commands, functions, and variables to "*Macro" and
    greatly expanded key macro functionality:
	- created "Macro" ring and "renameMacro" command.
	- changed string format of a key macro to always have the macro's name
	  (which is now mandatory) as the first item.
	- replaced $keyMacro global variable with new "manageMacro" function,
	  which perform various key macro operations, including setting and
	  retrieving key macros.
	- changed "xeqMacro" command to get a macro name (interactively or via a
	  script) if n <= 0 and execute the macro abs(n) times.
	- made "beginMacro" and "endMacro" commands interactive only.
	- added "Macro" type to "prompt" function, which provides the means
	  to do key macro name completions from a script.
	- renamed keyMacro.ms library file to macroUtil.ms and renamed all km*()
	  commands and functions within it to names without "km" prefix.
	- changed name of macro file in HOME directory from ".memacs-key" to
	  ".memacs-macros".
    Now key macros are known and referenced simply as "macros" everywhere; the
    leading "key" word is no longer needed.
13. Changed how rings are managed:
	- replaced all cycle*Ring, del*Ring, and show*Ring commands with
	  "cycleRing ring" (C-c &), "delRingEntry ring[, name]" (C-x &), and
	  "showRing ring" (C-h &) commands, and created user (shortcut) commands
	  in memacs.ms with same bindings as old commands that call the new
	  commands.
	- added ability to delete a macro by name to "delRingEntry" command.
	- eliminated all $*RingSize system variables (such as $killRingSize).
	- created "ringSize" (ESC R) command that provides the ability to get or
	  set the size of a ring, or get the current number of entries.
	- created $RingNames system constant, which returns array of ring names.
    Also changed default number of search ring entries from 20 to 40.
14. Added ability to do mode name and ring name completions with the "prompt"
    function via new "Mode" and "RingName" prompt types.
15. Changed "Mode" option of 'defined?' system function to return "buffer",
    "global", or nil instead of a Boolean result, so that the type of mode can
    be determined if it exists.
16. Changed "bufInfo" function to:
	- include a buffer's home directory (or nil if none) in the default
	  array that is returned.
	- use keyword option "Extended" instead of "Verbose", which better
	  describes its purpose.
	- not select visible buffers by default when processing multiple
	  buffers.
	- require that at least one of "Visible", "Hidden", "Command", or
	  "Function" keywords be specified when processing multiple buffers, to
	  be consistent with other buffer commands and functions that use
	  keywords.
17. Changed word characters to always be "a-zA-Z0-9_" (a constant), instead of
    the current value of $wordChars, and eliminated the $wordChars system
    variable.  Now word characters in regular expressions, word commands, and
    functions are always the same, regardless of programming language, which is
    simpler, consistent with widespread conventions, and easier to remember.
18. Switched internals library from ProLib to CXL.
19. Added CXL and XRE library versions to "about" command.
20. Created "sortRegion" (C-x S) command, which sorts region line(s) in a buffer
    in ascending or descending order and/or ignoring case in line comparisons,
    depending on options given.
21. Improved return message functionality:
	- eliminated feature where certain commands (like "selectScreen") would
	  only set a return message when run interactively.
	- changed processing so that 'RtnMsg' global mode is disabled before a
	  script is executed so that return messages are disabled by default
	  when a script is running.  The mode is restored to the previous state
	  after execution is completed.
	- changed "message" function to always set a return message (if
	  applicable), regardless of the state of the 'RtnMsg' global mode.
    Now return messages are disabled by default when scripts are executed,
    instead of enabled, as previously, which eliminates extraneous return
    messages and greatly simplifies the task of retaining and managing desirable
    ones.
22. Changed "writeFile" command to preserve "buffer changed" flag when temporary
    (n <= 0) write is performed.
23. Improved and fixed some "show" displays and options:
	- changed "showScreens" display so that the CWD line is first instead of
	  last.
	- changed "showBuffers" command to accept options if n argument that
	  control which buffers are included in display.
	- fixed ring-display commands to display tilde (~) characters properly.
24. Made hook changes:
	- created "exit" hook, which is run at program exit with n argument
	  given to 'exit' or 'quickExit' command.
	- converted "setHook" command to a function and changed to not allow nil
	  for the user function name (which previously cleared a hook).
	- created "clearHook" function, which clears named hook(s), or all hooks
	  if n <= 0.
25. Changed "findFiles" (C-x f) user command to do internal "grep" instead of
    [ef]grep via shell command so that full XRE syntax can be used, and
    (possibly changed) buffers for files that are already opened will be
    searched instead of files on disk.
26. Added options to "gotoMark" and "swapMark" commands to force reframing if
    n >= 0.
27. Changed the following functions and command to accept options only if n
    argument is not the default:
	include? [opts,] array, expr, ...
	message [opts,] arg, ...
	shellCmd [opts,] arg, ...
    and added 'Fail' option to 'message' function, which causes a false return
    (instead of using n < 0, as previously).
28. Changed all commands and functions that operate on white space to check for
    it via isspace() function instead of explicity checking for spaces and tabs,
    and to also treat null characters as white space where appropriate.
29. Changed script processing so that all arguments, including numeric literals,
    will be passed as strings to the -S, @file, or editor-startup script.  This
    is consistent with how shell scripts operate and simplifies argument
    checking and processing.
30. Modified Help System:
	- eliminated "help" command and "help" hook.
	- changed startup processing so that:
		. the site startup file (memacs.ms) and user startup file
		  (.memacs) are invoked with all command line arguments passed
		  as arguments.
		. all @file script arguments are invoked with all remaining
		  command line arguments passed as arguments.
	- modified routines in memacs.ms to handle entrance into Help System when
	  "ESC ?" is entered.
31. Changed processing at program termination so that newline and tab characters
    are passed unchanged to the terminal from an "exit" command message.
32. Renamed "Delimiters" option of "toStr" function to "Delimiter".
33. Fixed bug where the "shellCmd" command would occassionally not display any
    results when run interactively with no options.
34. Fixed bug where the top entry of the search or replace ring was not being
    set after deletion if more than one entry was deleted.
35. Reorganized project files on GitHub and in the installation directory
    (/usr/local) to be more in line with established conventions:
	- removed 'prolib-*' directory (which is superceded by CXL library).
	- moved contents of 'memacs-*' directory to top level and removed
	  the directory, which is no longer needed.
	- renamed 'lib' directory to 'scripts'.
	- moved all headers from 'src' directory to new 'include' directory.
	- changed installers to place files in /usr/local/share/memacs instead
	  of /usr/local/lib/memacs, as previously, and to create a 'scripts'
	  subdirectory for all scripts.

----------
9.4.0	22 Jul 2019


*** Changes from Previous Version

 1. Made significant improvements to the Help System:
	- created "hands on" tutorial and cheat sheet.
	- changed "showAliases" (C-h a), "showCommands" (C-h c), "showFunctions"
	  (C-h f), "showMacros" (C-h m), and "showVariables" (C-h v) commands to
	  always prompt for an apropos pattern when run interactively, instead
	  of only when n < 0, as previously.
 2. Implemented a "delete ring", which works just like the kill ring:
	- changed default key bindings for "chgDir (C-c d)" and "showDir (C-h
	  d)" commands to "C-c D" and "C-h D", respectively.
	- created $delRingSize system variable, which controls the size of the
	  delete ring.
	- created "delDelEntry" (C-x d), "cycleDelRing" (C-c d), "showDelRing"
	  (C-h d), and "undeleteCycle" (ESC U) commands for managing the delete
	  ring.
    Now the editor maintains a deletion history and older deletes can be
    accessed with the "ESC u" (undelete) and "ESC U" (undeleteCycle) commands.
 3. Simplified "yank revert" process:
	- created "revertYank" (C-x C-y) command, which reverts text insertion
	  from a prior "yank" (C-y), "yankCycle" (ESC C-y), "undelete" (ESC u),
	  or "undeleteCycle" (ESC U) command.
	- changed "yankCycle" (ESC C-y) command to do nothing if n == 0 instead
	  of removing text just inserted, as previously.
 4. Simplified line insertion:nnn
	- renamed "insertLineI" (C-x i) command to "openLineI" and changed
	  default key binding to "C-x o".
	- changed to use indentation from line preceding the target line instead
	  of the target line itself.
    Now a line can be opened above the current line with the same indentation as
    the line preceding the opened line by pressing "C-x o".
 5. Combined "chgBufMode" (C-x m) and "chgGlobalMode" (ESC m) commands into new
    "chgMode" (ESC m) command, which can change the state of either a buffer
    mode or a global mode.
 6. Changed "read only" feature:
	- deleted "RdOnly" buffer mode and created "ReadOnly" buffer attribute.
	- modified "chgBufAttr" (C-x a) and "showBuffers" (C-h b) commands to
	  process and display the new attribute, including changing "chgBufAttr"
	  command to not allow "ReadOnly" and "Changed" attributes to both be
	  set at the same time.
	- changed mode line so that a '#' character is displayed in same place
	  as '*' if the "ReadOnly" attribute is set.
 7. Simplified operation of several commands and functions:
	- Simplified use of the n argument by adding keyword options in lieu of
	  n argument values, which were hard to remember.
	- Standardized use of keyword arguments (except mode names) to conform
	  to the following rules:
		1. All keywords are specified as comma-separated values in a
		  single argument in a script.
		2. When obtained interactively:
			- keywords are listed in prompt with a unique letter
			  highlighted for each.
			- zero or more of the highlighted letters may be entered.
	- Changed operation of several commands and functions accordingly (see
	  Implementation Notes below).
 8. Greatly improved fence matching and fence commands:
	- created "showFence" (C-h C-h) command, which briefly displays the
	  fence matching the one at point.
	- changed default key bindings for all of the fence commands so that
	  they are easier to type (see Implementation Notes below).
	- renamed "Fence" global mode to "Fence1" and added "Fence2" global
	  mode, which includes "< >" fences, so that angle brackets can be
	  automatically highlighted in addition to other fences (or not) by
	  setting the correct fence mode.
 9. Simplified mark usage:
	- changed "markBuf" (ESC C-SPC) and "setMark" (C-SPC) commands to use
	  mark ?` (markBuf) or mark ?. (setMark) if n is the default, and prompt
	  for a mark otherwise.
	- changed "swapMark" (C-x C-x) command to always prompt for a mark,
	  instead of only when n >= 0, as previously.
	- changed "gotoMark" (ESC SPC) command to delete the mark if n < 0,
	  instead of when n is not the default, as previously.
    Now mark ?` is no longer used automatically when n < 0 (which was somewhat
    confusing), and custom marks are easier to use.
10. Change "wrapLine" (ESC RTN) command and auto-wrapping (when "Wrap" mode is
    set) to wrap lines correctly (ignoring invisible characters) when they
    contain terminal attribute specifications and the "TermAttr" buffer
    attribute is set.
11. Changed "bfFormatItem" (ESC .) macro in "blockFormat" package to recognize
    and rewrap plain line blocks (bounded by blank lines or a buffer boundary at
    top or bottom) in addition to comment blocks and numbered list items.
12. Changed "truncBuf" (ESC t) command to prompt for confirmation when run
    interactively.
13. Made improvements to "queryReplace" (ESC q) command:
	- added 'r' Restart option, which restarts search from original buffer
	  position.
	- added special prompt when scan completed so that user can decide
	  whether to quit, go back, undo, or restart (instead of just quitting
	  and staying at last position, as previously).
14. Changed "delBlankLines" (C-x C-o) command to delete blank lines immediately
    above current line instead of below if n < 0.
15. Changed multi-buffer save process:
	- changed to skip multi-homed check when saving a buffer if all screens
	  have the same working directory.
	- changed to skip narrowed buffers and display count of any that were
	  skipped so that user is aware of it.
16. Created "writeBuf" (C-x *) command, which:
	- writes lines (or characters if n >= 0) in a region from current buffer
	  to another buffer.
	- deletes the text that was written if n <= 0.
17. Changed "writeFile" (C-x C-w) command to not set the buffer's filename or
    change the buffer name if n <= 0 (instead of always setting the filename but
    not changing the buffer name if n <= 0, as previously).  Now a portion of a
    buffer can be written to a file by narrowing the buffer, invoking writeFile
    with n <= 0, then widening the buffer again.
18. Swapped default key bindings of "lowerCaseRegion", "titleCaseRegion", and
    "upperCaseRegion" commands with "lowerCaseLine", "titleCaseLine", and
    "upperCaseLine".
19. Improved display of information on message line generated by "showPoint"
    (C-h .) command.
20. Changed "showBuffers" (C-h b) command to include an indicator that shows
    which buffers are in the "background".
21. Simplified screen creation and redrawing process:
	- changed "selectScreen" (ESC s) command to:
		. require an integer argument (always) and ignore the numeric
		  argument.
		. create a screen and switch to it if the argument is zero.
		. no longer refresh the current screen when n <= 0.
	- changed "resetTerm" (ESC ESC ) command to always redraw the current
	  screen (even if the terminal size has not changed) and ignore the
	  numeric argument.
	- changed default binding for "reframeWind" command from "ESC l" to
	  "C-x .", which makes more sense and puts it in the "C-x family" with
	  the other window-management commands.
22. Made improvements to the scripting language (MScript):
	- combined "bufMode?" and "globalMode?" functions into new "mode?"
	  function, which checks if one or more buffer or global modes are
	  enabled and returns Boolean result.
	- improved file pathname processing:
		. created "expandPath" function, which expands "~/", "~user/",
		  "$var", and "${var}" in its given string argument and returns
		  the result.
		. changed all file commands and functions so that "~/" or
		  "~user/" (at beginning of a string), "$var", and "${var}" can
		  be specified in any filename argument and will be expanded
		  automatically, as is done interactively.
	- changed how buffer size information is obtained:
		. eliminated "bufSize" function.
		. created "bufInfo" function, which returns various information
		  about a buffer or multiple buffers per an option argument.
		. created "bempty?" function, which checks if current buffer is
		  empty (or named buffer if n argument) and returns Boolean
		  result.
	- renamed $bufName system variable to $bufname.
	- fixed problem where case-insensitive array comparisons in "include?"
	  function were failing.
	- renamed all commands and macros containing the word "delete" to "del"
	  (see Implementation Notes).
	- changed syntax and/or functionality of several commands and functions
	  (see Implementation Notes).
23. Fixed some bugs:
	- Fixed problem where the "Col" and "Line" modes were not being
	  displayed correctly on the mode line.
	- Fixed problem where executing the "shellCmd" (C-x !) command would
	  sometimes cause program to hang; for example, when running the "man
	  less" shell command.
	- Fixed issues in "bindKey" (ESC k) and "unbindKey" (ESC C-k) commands
	  where the return messages were not being displayed properly on the
	  message line when the commands were run interactively.
	- Fixed bug where pressing "C-q" (quoteChar) immediately after starting
	  the editor caused the cursor to move to the bottom-left corner of
	  screen.
	- Fixed issue where the program could crash during terminal input if the
	  input line contained multiple control characters.
	- Fixed bug where text following a hard tab was not aligned at a tab
	  stop if the "TermAttr" buffer attribute was set and the text before
	  the tab character contained one or more "~~" sequences.

	chgGlobalMode
 5. New commands and functions:
	COMMANDS					FUNCTIONS
	chgMode bufname,modes		ESC m		bempty? [bufname]

 7. New system variables:
	$delRingSize
 8. Mode and buffer attribute changes:
	- "RdOnly" buffer mode was deleted and a "ReadOnly" buffer attribute was

	  created, which includes "< >" fences.

----------
9.3.0	31 Mar 2019


*** Changes from Previous Version

 1. Fixed bugs in "let" command:
	- Fixed issue where the value of a variable was being set
	  (interactively) to the prompt string instead of the value that was
	  entered unless the value was an expression or an integer.  This
	  usually caused a bogus error to be displayed as a result and the
	  variable was not changed.
	- Fixed problem where the program would crash when attempting to set the
	  $lastKeySeq or $searchDelim system variable.
 2. Fixed problem on Linux platforms where pressing "control+h" would generate
    "DEL" instead of "C-h" unless TERM was xterm-256color.
 3. Replaced $displayColors system variable with new "setDispColor" function,
    which provides a means to set colors for a display item, and changed its
    operation to always set "no color" for an item if its color is set to nil.
 4. Changed "getInfo" function to return an array of current color numbers for
    all display items when the keyword is "Colors", and return number of colors
    and pairs avaiable (as previously) if an n argument is specified.
 5. Made library changes:
	- Renamed "grepFiles" macro to "findFiles", changed its key binding to
	  "C-x f", and added option to bypass the search pattern prompt if
	  n <= 0.
	- Created "getFile" (C-x C-g) macro, which finds a file and opens it in
	  a new screen (and also sets its buffer to read-only if n <= 0).
	- Fixed problem in "showBindings" (C-x n) macro where tildes (~) were
	  not being displayed in key bindings.
 6. Changed buffer editing when assigning a value to the $lineText system
    variable so that the target line is not deleted if it is empty, and the
    point is left at the end of the assigned text.
 7. Combined $TermCols and $TermRows system constants into new $TermSize
    constant which contains the same values as a two- element array.
 8. Changed screen display so that the keyboard macro recording indicator is
    always displayed on the mode line of the bottom window (making it more
    conspicuous) instead of the current window, as previously.


*** Implementation Notes

 1. Deleted $displayColors system constant.
 2. Created "setDispColor" function, which sets (or removes) color for a display
    item.
 3. Changed "getInfo" function to return current colors of display items by
    default for the "Colors" keyword.
 4. Renamed "grepFiles" macro to "findFiles".
 5. Combined $TermCols and $TermRows system constants into new $TermSize
    constant.

----------
9.2.0	17 Mar 2019


*** Changes from Previous Version

 1. Added color:
	- Created "showColors" command, which displays all colors available for
	  the terminal being used.
	- Created "$displayColors" system variable, which provides a means to
	  set colors for mode lines and informational displays.
	- Changed startup processing to display mode lines in color by default.
	- Redesigned informational displays ("show*" commands) to be easier to
	  read and to be shown in color by default.
	- Created "setColorPair" function, which assigns a foreground and
	  background color of your choosing to a "color pair number", and added
	  terminal attribute specifications for enabling (~<n>c) and disabling
	  (~C) color, which can be used in combination with color pair number(s)
	  to display colored strings in a buffer or on the message line.
	- Added "Colors" item to "getInfo" function which returns an array of
	  basic color information, or nil if color not enabled.
 2. Improved shell command processing:
	- Renamed "filterBuf" command to "pipeBuf", changed default key binding
	  to "C-x |", changed to allow a shell pipeline as the command to
	  execute, and changed to provide the option of saving the command
	  result to a new buffer instead of always reading the result into the
	  current buffer, as previously.
	- Changed all shell commands to operate internally with OS pipes instead
	  of temporary files, to capture results in buffers, and display any
	  errors in a pop-up window.
    Now the shell family of commands work very efficiently and handle errors
    cleanly.
 3. Eliminated the "False return" message that was displayed when attempting to
    move the point beyond a buffer boundary (which was annoying and confusing),
    except when a keyboard macro is executing.
 4. Changed display code to skip over invalid terminal attribute specifications
    in a buffer or on the message line instead of displaying them literally,
    which makes more sense.
 5. Changed "quoteChar" command to operate abs(n) times and ignore "Over" and
    "Repl" buffer modes if n < 0, and changed self-insertion code to operate the
    same way for unbound characters.
 6. Added automatic calls to "resetTerm" command when the terminal window is
    resized (with the mouse) so that the editor's screen(s) always match the
    size of the terminal window.
 7. Provided option for "bufMode?", "globalMode?", and "groupMode?" functions to
    ignore any non-existent mode or group name so that a running script will not
    fail in that case.
 8. Created official name for the scripting language: MScript, changed filename
    extension for script files from ".mm" to ".ms" to match language name, and
    renamed all "memacs*" macros in script files to "ms*".
 9. Changed default installation directory for Debian Linux to /usr/local (just
    like all other platforms), so it is no longer treated as a special case.
10. Bug fixes:
	- Fixed issue where the current line in a buffer containing a terminal
	  attribute specification was being left in the "rendered" state after
	  (a), a right fence character was typed; (b), its matching fence
	  character was displayed; and (c), the cursor was returned to the line.
	- Fixed issue where a language buffer mode was sometimes not being set
	  when switching windows.
	- Fixed issue where setting a variable to an expression interactively
	  was sometimes failing and returning a non-sensical error message.
	- Fixed other minor issues.


*** Implementation Notes

 1. Script files now use a ".ms" filename extension instead of ".mm".
 2. Changed "~0" terminal attribute specification to "~Z" so that a numeric
    prefix can be specified in an attribute specification without ambiguity
    (such as "~<n>c" to enable color, where <n> is a number).
 3. Changes to the scripting language (MScript):
	- Changed "bufMode?" and "globalMode?" functions to check if all modes
	  are enabled if n >= 0 (instead of when n is not the default, as
	  previously), and to ignore any non-existent mode if n <= 0.
	- Changed "groupMode?" function to do a global mode check if n >= 0
	  (instead of when n is not the default, as previously), and to ignore
	  any non-existent group name (and return nil) if n <= 0.

----------
9.1.1	6 Jan 2019


*** Changes from Previous Version

 1. Bug fixes:
	- Fixed issue where the "detabLine" and "entabLine" commands would not
	  accept an integer argument (the tab size) when executed in a script.
	- Fixed issue where a new filename for a buffer would not be set if it
	  matched the buffer name.
 2. Changed return message processing:
	- Created "high priority" option for informational messages which causes
	  a message tagged as such to override any non-high-priority message set
	  previously.
	- Changed most built-in commands which previously forced a return
	  message to use the "high priority" tag instead so that messages such
	  as "nn substitutions" (from the "replace" and "queryReplace" commands)
	  can be suppressed in a script by disabling "RtnMsg" global mode.
	- Changed "message" function to set the high priority flag for a message
	  if abs(n) == 1 and force the message if abs(n) > 1, instead of force
	  (only) if n != 0, as previously.
 3. Added "quick start" topic to Help System.


*** Implementation Notes

 1. Changes to the scripting language:
	- "message" function now forces a message when abs(n) > 1 instead of
	  n != 0.

----------
9.1.0	19 Nov 2018


*** Changes from Previous Version

 1. Made major improvements to mode system:
	- Eliminated "show" modes -- deleted "alterShowMode" command,
	  "showMode?" function, and $ShowModes variable.
	- Added support for user-defined modes, in addition to built-in ones.
	- Created mode groups, which provide a means to group similar modes
	  (like programming languages) so that their states and types can be
	  controlled.
	- Added ability to change type (global or buffer) of most modes at any
	  time.
	- Created "editMode" (C-c m) and "editModeGroup" (C-c g) commands, which
	  provide the means to create and edit modes and mode groups.
	- Changed "Bak" mode to be a buffer mode by default instead of global.
	- Added option to "defined?" function to check for the existence of
	  modes and groups.
	- Created "groupMode?" function, which checks if a mode in a group is
	  enabled and returns its name if so; otherwise, nil.
	- Renamed "alterBufMode" and "alterGlobalMode" commands to "chgBufMode"
	  and "chgGlobalMode", and changed both to not do a "clear all" when
	  n < -1, and allow no arguments when n > 1 instead, which serves the
	  same purpose.
	- Changed "mode" hook to take two arguments, either: nil and old
	  $GlobalModes value if a global mode was changed, or buffer name and
	  old $BufModes value if a buffer mode was changed.
	- Changed "getInfo 'Modes'" function to return an array containing all
	  modes, their parent group (if any), and their attributes.
	- Created "Fence" mode, which enables left fence highlighting when a
	  right fence is typed; for example, the matching '{' is highlighted
	  when '}' is typed.
	- Changed default binding for "showModes" commmand to "C-h m" (instead
	  of "C-h M").
    Now modes can be created, modified, and deleted, and used to control user-
    defined operations such as programming language formatting.
 2. Removed all built-in language formatting (for C, MightEMacs, Perl, Ruby, and
    Shell), reimplemented it in external script libraries, and created libraries
    for most other major programming languages.  Editor now does auto-formatting
    for C, C++, HTML, Java, JavaScript, MightEMacs, Perl, PHP, macOS PList,
    Python, Ruby, Rust, Shell, SQL, and Swift languages.
 3. Changed internal buffer management:
	- Changed how lines are managed such that the last line of a buffer no
	  longer contains an implicit newline delimiter.
	- Created "ATerm" ("auto-termination") mode, which, when enabled, causes
	  a newline to be automatically appended to a buffer if it is missing
	  when the buffer is written to disk.
	- Changed "insertBuf", "insertFile", and "insertPipe" commands to insert
	  lines (possibly without a terminating newline) at point instead of at
	  the beginning of the current line, as previously.
 4. Changed message line management:
	- Renamed "clearMsg" function to "clearMsgLine", to clarify its purpose.
	- Changed "clearMsgLine", "print", and "printf" functions to always
	  write to message line regardless of "Msg" mode state, and removed
	  "force" option from the functions, which is no longer needed.
	- Changed "showPoint" command to write results directly to message line
	  instead of setting a return message, as previously.
	- Renamed "Msg" global mode to "RtnMsg" to clarify that it now controls
	  return messages only.
	- Changed "run" command to set "RtnMsg" mode when interactive state is
	  enabled, then restore the mode's previous state.
	- Replaced "success" and "failure" functions with new "message"
	  function, which takes options ("NoWrap", "TermAttr") as its first
	  argument and uses the n argument to control the "force" option and
	  return value.
    Now "RtnMsg" global mode controls return messages only, messages from new
    "message" function have same priority as built-in commands by default (are
    no longer implicitly forced), and text that is written directly to message
    line during script execution will always be displayed.
 5. Improved hook system:
	- Created "filename" hook, which is called whenever a filename in a
	  buffer is changed.
	- Changed hook execution to not allow recursion.
	- Changed "prekey" hook to not pass a key literal argument (which can be
	  obtained from $lastKeySeq variable), and changed "postKey" hook to
	  pass return value from "preKey" hook as an argument, or nil if
	  "preKey" hook not set.
	- Changed "showHooks" display to be easier to read, wrap lines properly,
	  and show macro arguments more clearly.
 6. Made changes to the scripting language:
	- Implemented in-line comments of form "/#...#/" so that a comment can
	  be added to a line in a script without adversely affecting any
	  continuation lines that follow it.
	- Changed evaluation of an array slice "ary[i,len]" to allow length to
	  exceed the number of elements beyond index and to return all remaining
	  elements in that case.
	- Implemented a pseudo "char" type as an 8-bit integer.
	- Added ability to use the Ruby-style "?x" character literal in an
	  expression (which evaluates it to a 8-bit integer), where "x" may be a
	  character or any \x escape sequence allowed in a double-quoted string;
	  for example, ?" or ?\s (for a space).
	- Changed $lineChar system variable to return/set current character in
	  line as an ASCII integer value (char) instead of a string, and insert
	  a newline into the buffer if the variable is set to a newline
	  character.
	- Changed the following commands and functions to interpret specific
	  arguments as char (ASCII integer) instead of string: "defined?",
	  "deleteMark", "gotoMark", "markBuf", "setMark", "swapMark" (mark
	  argument), "split", "strPop", "strShift" (delimiter argument), and
	  "wordChar?" (character argument).
	- Added "constrain" modifier which can be specified immediately before
	  the word "macro" in a macro definition.  If specified, the macro that
	  is defined is designated to be a "helper" routine and may not be bound
	  to a key or run interactively, and is not included in the "showMacros"
	  display by default.  Additionally, a macro must be defined as
	  contrained to be set to a hook.
	- Nested macro definitions are no longer allowed, which was a
	  non-standard feature of dubious value.
 7. Made command and function changes:
	- Changed detabLine and entabLine commands to accept a tab size argument
	  so that $hardTabSize can be overridden.
	- Created "glob" function, which returns a (possibly empty) array of
	  pathnames that match a shell glob pattern.
	- Changed "pathname" function to accept an array as an argument and
	  return an array of absolute pathnames in that case instead of a
	  string.
	- Changed "xPathname" function to treat its argument as an absolute
	  pathname only if it begins with a slash (/) instead of "contains a
	  slash", as previously; accept a glob pattern as an argument and return
	  a (possibly empty) array of pathnames that match in that case instead
	  of a string; and skip null directories in $execPath during scan if n
	  <= 0.
	- Created "getWord" function, which extracts the previous, current, or
	  next word from current buffer relative to point and returns it.
	- Fixed "sub" function so that any value of n is valid, and first
	  occurrence of pattern is substituted if n <= 1; otherwise, all.
	- Changed "gotoFence" command to accept "from" fence as an argument if n
	  is not the default.
	- Changed "prompt" function to allow quoting for single character input
	  ('c' type) via C-q so that C-q, RTN, C-j, and C-SPC can be input in
	  raw form.
	- Changed "index" function to interpret its pattern argument as a
	  character if n <= 0 and find rightmost occurrence of pattern or
	  character if n >= 0.
	- Changed "prompt" function to return result as an ASCII (int) character
	  when type is 'c' and require the default value to also be char, if
	  specified.
	- Changed "empty?" function to accept a character (int) argument and
	  return true if it's an ASCII null (zero).
	- Changed "eval" command to not provide an evaluation option during
	  terminal input, which was overkill.
	- Changed "binding" function to accept a command or macro name as an
	  argument if n > 0 and return an array of its key bindings in that
	  case, or return a standardized key literal (as previously) if n <= 0.
	- Changed "alterBufAttr" command to not do a "clear all" when n < -1,
	  and allow no arguments when n > 1 instead, which serves the same
	  purpose.
	- Changed "alias" command to replace any existing alias if n > 0.
 8. Changed mark system:
	- Changed region mark from ' ' to '.' and "work" mark from '.' to '`'.
	- Changed mark system to no longer allow a space character or tilde (~)
	  to be used as a mark, which are problematic to display.
	- Changed mark commands to display marks on message line underlined
	  instead of in single quotes so that they do not look like strings.
 9. Changed mode line updating so that the editor name and version are displayed
    on the mode line at the bottom of the screen only, are at the far right
    instead of the beginning of the line, and displayed only if room is
    available.
10. Created $LastKey system variable, which holds the ordinal value of the last
    7-bit ASCII character entered, or -1 if an extended key or 8-bit character
    was entered.  This is intended to be used by language-formatting macros for
    quick access to user keystrokes.
11. Created "selectLine" function, which gets a line block (default) or text
    block (if n argument) per its numeric argument; moves point to beginning of
    region if region not empty; and returns number of lines selected.  This is
    intended to be used in scripts by macros that emulate line or text commands.
12. Renamed "lowerCaseString", "titleCaseString", "upperCaseString", and
    "toString" to "lowerCaseStr", "titleCaseStr", "upperCaseStr", and "toStr" to
    be consistent with other function names.
13. Changed "detabLine", "entabLine", "indentRegion", "outdentRegion",
    "trimLine", "lowerCaseLine", "titleCaseLine", and "upperCaseLine" commands
    to mark target line block as a region after processing completed (in
    addition to moving point to end of block).
14. Modified working directory commands and hooks:
	- Renamed "chDir" command and hook to "chgDir" to be consistent with
	  "chgBufMode" and "chgGlobalMode" commands.
	- Created "showDir" (C-h d) command, which displays current working
	  directory on message line.
	- Created "pwd" alias to "showDir" command.
	- Removed "pwd" macro and key binding from memacs.mm.
15. Fixed bug where entries on the search ring could be duplicated in certain
    situations.


*** Implementation Notes

 1. Changes to the scripting language:
	- Removed "alterShowMode" command, "showMode?" function, and $ShowModes
	  variable.
	- Renamed "alterBufMode" and "alterGlobalMode" commands to "chgBufMode"
	  and "chgGlobalMode" and changed how n is interpreted.
	- "getInfo('Modes')" now returns more information.
	- Renamed "Msg" global mode to "RtnMsg".
	- Changed "Bak" mode to be a buffer mode by default instead of global.
	- Changed "clearMsg", "print", and "printf" functions to always write to
	  message line regardless of "Msg" mode state, and removed "force"
	  option from the functions.
	- Replaced "success" and "failure" functions with new "message"
	  function.
	- Implemented in-line comments of form "/#...#/".
	- Changed evaluation of an array slice "ary[i,len]" to allow a large
	  length value.
	- Added "?x" character literal.
	- Changed the following to require a "char" argument or value:
	  "defined?", "deleteMark", "gotoMark", "markBuf", "setMark", "split",
	  "strPop", "strShift", "swapMark", "wordChar?", and $lineChar.
	- Changed "detabLine" and "entabLine" commands to require a tab-size
	  argument.
	- Changed operation of "alterBufAttr" command, and "binding", "empty?",
	  "index", "prompt", and "sub" functions.
	- Changed region mark from ' ' to ?. and "work" mark from '.' to ?`.
	- Space and tilde marks are no longer allowed.
	- Macros may now be defined with a "constrain" modifier, which
	  immediately precedes the "macro" keyword.
	- New commands: "editMode", "editModeGroup", and "showDir".
	- New functions: "getWord", "groupMode?", "glob", and "selectLine".
	- New variables: $LastKey.
	- Renamed command "chDir" to "chgDir".
	- Renamed functions "clearMsg", "lowerCaseString", "titleCaseString",
	  "upperCaseString", and "toString" to "clearMsgLine", "lowerCaseStr",
	  "titleCaseStr", "upperCaseStr", and "toStr".
 2. Hook changes:
	- Renamed "chDir" hook to "chgDir".
	- Changed "mode" hook to take two arguments, either: nil and old
	  $GlobalModes value if a global mode was changed, or buffer name and
	  old $BufModes value if a buffer mode was changed.
	- Created "filename" hook, which is called whenever a filename in a
	  buffer is changed.
	- Changed "prekey" hook to not pass a key literal argument, and changed
	  "postKey" hook to pass return value from "preKey" hook as an argument,
	  or nil if "preKey" hook not set.
 3. Changes to mode system and language formatting:
	- The editor now loads additional initialization files at startup which
	  define modes and formatting parameters for programming languages.  New
	  languages may be added by creating an "Init" file and optional "Lib"
	  file in the library directory (usually /usr/local/lib/memacs).  See
	  comments at beginning of file lang.mm for details.
	- The types of most modes may now be changed from global to buffer or
	  vice versa via the "editMode" command.  The "showModes" display
	  indicates which ones are "scope locked" and which ones are not.

----------
9.0.2	23 Sep 2018
 1. Fixed terminal input for the searchForw, searchBack, queryReplace, and
    replace commands so that the most recently-entered pattern will be displayed
    first when C-p is typed.
 2. Changed the cycleSearchRing and cycleReplaceRing commands to set the pattern
    at top of ring if possible, after the ring is cycled (like deleteSearchPat).
 3. Changed filename completions to sort the filename list before displaying it.
 4. Added return-value information to command descriptions for lastBuf,
    scratchBuf, beginText, beginLine, and endLine.

----------
9.0.1	16 Apr 2018
 1. Simplified Linux building and installation: combined "Debian", "CentOS", and
    "Red Hat" platforms into single "Linux" platform (and preprocessor macro) so
    that one binary is created and shared among all GNU/Linux variants.
 2. Changed how $execPath is set at startup for Linux version when MMPATH is not
    set: if directory /usr/lib/memacs exists, path is set to ":/usr/lib/memacs";
    otherwise, ":/usr/local/lib/memacs", as usual.
 3. Changed the "searchForw", "searchBack", "queryReplace", and "replace"
    commands to not display the current pattern as the default when prompting
    for a search or replacement pattern so that the line does not have to be
    cleared to enter a new pattern.  The most recently-entered pattern can still
    be accessed if desired by entering C-p, as usual.

----------
9.0.0	13 Jan 2018
 1. Made major improvements to terminal input:
	- Added cursor movement and line editing capabilities to terminal input,
	  including automatic horizontal scrolling and several editing keys; for
	  example: C-u (erase line), C-k (erase to end of line), and C-SPC
	  (erase line and return a null string).
	- Changed all terminal input to display the default value (if any) in
	  the input area instead of at the end of prompt string so that it can
	  be edited.
	- Added new input types to the "prompt" function, including: 'o' and 'O'
	  for reading one keystroke or one key sequence verbatim.
	- Created $maxPromptPct system variable, which is the maximum percentage
	  of current terminal width to use for a prompt string (default 80).
 2. Redesigned kill ring:
	- Changed kill ring to operate as a true circular ring, where the ring
	  contains and cycles only the kills that were added to the ring (no
	  empty slots), and the oldest kill is pushed out only when the ring
	  is full.
	- Changed processing so that successive copies or kills can now be
	  prepended to the previous one in addition to being appended.
	- Changed kill-retrieval process:
		. Renamed "yankPop" command to "yankCycle" (which better
		  describes its purpose) and changed its binding from "ESC y"
		  to "ESC C-y", which is more consistent with the "C-y" binding
		  for the "yank" command.
		. Changed "yank" and "yankCycle" commands to operate more
		  intuitively and mark yanked text as a region.  Also added
		  "undo" feature to "yankCycle".
		. Created "deleteKill" (C-x k) command which deletes one or
		  more kills from the kill ring.
	- Changed key binding of "cycleKillRing" command to "C-c k".
 3. Created "search" and "replace" rings:
	- Integrated search and replace system with new search and replace
	  rings, which hold recent patterns that have been entered.
	- Changed terminal input for the "searchForw", "searchBack", "replace",
	  and "queryReplace" commands so that entries on the search and replace
	  rings can be retrieved by pressing C-p, up-arrow, C-n, or down-arrow.
	- Created "showSearchRing" (C-h s), "showReplaceRing" (C-h r),
	  "cycleSearchRing" (C-c s), "cycleReplaceRing" (C-c r),
	  "deleteSearchPat" (C-x s), and "deleteReplacePat" (C-x r) commands,
	  which display, cycle, and delete entries from the search and replace
	  rings.
	- Added 'K' (kill ring), 'S' (search ring), and 'R' (replace ring) input
	  types to the "prompt" function, which enable ring access during
	  terminal input.
 4. Greatly improved handling of soft tabs:
	- Created "backspace" command, which deletes characters or soft tabs
	  backward, giving preference to the latter if soft tabs are enabled.
	- Set default binding of "backspace" command to "DEL" and
	  "deleteBackChar" command to "ESC DEL".
	- Changed the "tab" command to insert soft tabs such that the first non-
	  space character at or ahead of point (instead of point) is moved to
	  the next tab stop, which mimics the deletion process.
 5. Created $killRingSize, $searchRingSize, and $replaceRingSize system
    variables, which specify a maximum size for the corresponding ring (or an
    unlimited size if set to zero) and provide a means for changing the size of
    any ring during an editing session.
 6. Changed key binding system:
	- Redesigned key binding tables so that any key in addition to a plain
	  character (like a function key or S-TAB) can be used as the second key
	  of a key sequence.
	- Changed interpretation of a key sequence such that upper and lower
	  case letters produce unique and separate bindings instead of the same
	  binding as previously.  For example, "C-c a" and "C-c A" are now
	  different key bindings.
	- Key literals (like "TAB") may now be in any case.
	- The meta prefix is now encoded as "ESC " instead of "M-".  The latter
	  syntax is still recognized, but is no longer preferred.
	- Added option to "binding" function to return a key binding in
	  standardized (string) form if an n argument is specified.
    Now any single key, including a function key, can be used as the second key
    of a key sequence, key sequences containing a letter as the second key can
    be bound separately by case (just like non-prefixed letters), and key
    sequences containing an upper case letter as the second key are unbound by
    default.
 7. Added support for terminal attributes in windows and on message line:
	- Text displayed in a window, a pop-up window, or on the message line
	  may now include phrases that are underlined, in bold, or in reverse
	  video (or all three) by coding special formating sequences in the text
	  that begin with the '~' (tilde) character.  Specifications are "~b"
	  (begin bold), "~r" (begin reverse video), "~u" (begin underlining),
	  "~#u" (begin underlining, skipping spaces), "~U" (end underlining),
	  "~0" (end all attributes), and "~~" (display literal "~").  A
	  "terminal attributes" buffer attribute was also created so that this
	  feature can be enabled or disabled in a window.
	- Changed n arguments of "abort", "failure", "print", "printf",
	  "prompt", and "success" functions so that attribute processing can
	  be enabled for the prompt argument of the prompt function and the
	  string that is produced by the other functions if desired.
	- Changed several messages displayed on message line to include bolding
	  and/or underlining to improve readability; for example, output from
	  the "showKey" command, and the help text displayed when viewing a pop-
	  up window and pressing the '?' key.
 8. Redesigned informational displays:
	- Eliminated memacs-guide.1 and memacs-macros.1 man pages and
	  incorporated their content into new interactive Help System which is
	  entered via the "help" command (ESC ?) and provides help pages for
	  both the beginner and advanced user.
	- Changed display format for "show" commands to be less terse and easier
	  to read, including multiple lines per item, automatic wrapping of
	  descriptive text to fit in the current terminal width, and the use of
	  bolded and underlined text where appropriate.
	- Renamed "showBindings" (C-h n) command to "showCommands" (C-h c) and
	  created "showAliases" (C-h a) and "showMacros" (C-h @) commands.
	- Changed key binding of "about" command to "C-h A".
	- Replaced "apropos" macro in "memacs.mm" with "apropos" command
	  (ESC a), which creates a combined listing of all commands, functions,
	  aliases, macros, and variables which match the search pattern.
	- Changed matching process for the "apropos" command and the apropos
	  function of the "show" commands such that regular expression or
	  case-sensitive matching may be done by appending option letters to the
	  search pattern.
	- Changed "showKey" command to display the key description in a pop-up
	  window by default or if n < 0 so that long descriptions, which may be
	  truncated on the message line, can be viewed on the screen in their
	  entirety.
	- Added descriptions of numeric argument and macro arguments to
	  "showHooks" display.
	- Changed "showBuffers" command to include hidden, non-macro buffers in
	  display if n == -1 and to show all buffers if n < -1 (instead of n < 0
	  as previously).
	- Created "showBindings" macro (C-h n), which displays all possible key
	  bindings in a pop-up window.
 9. Changed command-line switch processing:
	- Changed editor to use the getswitch() routine in ProLib to parse
	  switches and arguments.
	- Renamed and/or added word aliases to most switches (formerly single
	  letters) and changed parsing to require white space between a switch
	  and its argument, like most other Unix/Linux commands; for example,
	  -d or -dir may be used to specify an initial working directory.
	- Replaced +<num>[:pos] "go to" switch with +<num> and -<num> switches,
	  which now move point to the specified line number from the beginning
	  (+) or end (-) of the buffer (and eliminated the line position
	  option).
	- Added validation checks to -s, +, and - argument switches.  Any one of
	  these switches may now be specified after any file argument, which
	  will trigger that file to be read at startup instead of the first
	  file, as previously.
	- Replaced -r and -R switches with a -r command switch and -r and -rw
	  argument switches.
	- Added -otp-delim (-o) switch for specifying output file record
	  delimiter(s), and -buf-mode (-B) argument switch for specifying
	  initial buffer modes for a data file.
	- Removed -D (default mode) switch.
10. Made command and function improvements:
	- Changed handling of the current working directory so that the
	  directory may be set on a per screen basis and automatically changed
	  when switching screens.
	- Added 'Y' response option to "queryReplace" command for "replace and
	  stop here".
	- Split "notice" function into two functions: "success" and "failure",
	  which always return true and false, respectively.  Now it is very
	  obvious if a macro is returning success or failure, and the new
	  function options are greatly simplified.
	- Created "printf" function, which operates identically to the "print"
	  function, except that it accepts a format string and optional
	  arguments, like the "sprintf" function.
	- Renamed "readBuf" and "writeBuf" functions to "bgets" and "bprint",
	  and created "bprintf" function, which writes a formatted string to a
	  buffer.
	- Changed "lastBuf" command to operate on a per screen basis.
	- Added option to "truncBuf" command to delete backward from point to
	  beginning of buffer if n <= 0.
	- Created "interactive?" function, which returns true if script is being
	  executed interactively; otherwise, false.
	- Added options to "backPage", "backPageNext", "backPagePrev",
	  "forwPage", "forwPageNext", and "forwPagePrev" commands to scroll
	  window backward or forward by half a page if n < 0.
	- Added options to stat? function: (1), returns true if any type letter
	  matches, for default n (as previously); and (2), returns true if all
	  type letters match, for non-default n.
	- Changed include? function to: (1), accept multiple value arguments;
	  (2), return true if any of the values are in the array (default n or
	  n == 0) or all values are in the array (n != 0); and (3), ignore case
	  in string comparisons if n <= 0.
	- Changed all commands which prompt for a buffer name (such as
	  "selectBuf") to not display a default value (a guess) at the prompt
	  unless only two visible buffers exist.
	- Changed "let" command (C-x =) to display the current value of the
	  variable being changed in the prompt and read a key or key sequence
	  instead of a key-binding literal for the $searchDelim and $lastKeySeq
	  variables.
	- Changed "seti" command to set i (only) if n >= 0, but display all
	  parameters on message line instead if n < 0.
	- Added optional buffer name argument to "setBufName" and "setBufFile"
	  commands and renamed the former to "renameBuf".
	- Changed "deleteBuf" command to ignore any buffers being displayed when
	  deleting all unmodified buffers (n == 0) or all buffers (n == 1).
	- Changed "setWrapCol" command to remember previous wrap column and
	  switch back to it if n < 0.
	- Changed "beginWhite" and "deleteWhite" commands to operate on white
	  space immediately before point (if any) if character at point is not
	  white space.
	- Renamed "sysInfo" function to "getInfo", changed to use keywords (such
	  as "Version") instead of the numeric prefix to select an informational
	  item, and added keywords such as "Buffers" and "Windows".  Also
	  deleted "bufList" and "windList" functions, which are no longer
	  needed.
	- Renamed the following constants, functions, and commands to add
	  clarity and be consistent with other object names in MightEMacs and in
	  other programming languages:
		$ArgVector	->	$ARGV
		lcString	->	lowerCaseString
		tcString	->	titleCaseString
	  	ucString	->	upperCaseString
	  	subLine		->	subline
	  	subString	->	substr
	  	stringFit	->	strFit
		lcLine		->	lowerCaseLine
		lcRegion	->	lowerCaseRegion
		lcWord		->	lowerCaseWord
		tcWord		->	titleCaseWord
		ucLine		->	upperCaseLine
		ucRegion	->	upperCaseRegion
		ucWord		->	upperCaseWord
		copyFencedText	->	copyFencedRegion
		deleteFencedText->	deleteFencedRegion
		killFencedText	->	killFencedRegion
		whence		->	showPoint
	- Improved case-conversion:
		. Created "titleCaseLine" (C-x t) and "titleCaseRegion"
		  (C-x C-t) commands, which were missing from the group of
		  commands that change the case of letters and words.  Also
		  changed default binding of "trimLine" command from "C-x C-t"
		  to "C-x C-\".
		. Changed "lowerCaseWord", "titleCaseWord", and "upperCaseWord"
		  commands to perform conversion in a backward direction if n is
		  negative and leaves point at ending position in that case.
		. Changed "lowerCaseRegion", "titleCaseRegion", and
		  "upperCaseRegion" commands to leave point at opposite end of
		  region after conversion (for visual effect).
	- Changed all commands that edit a block of lines (like "detabLine" and
	  "trimLine") to operate the same way, including moving the point to the
	  end of the block when completed, reporting the number of lines that
	  were changed, and not putting the buffer into a changed state if no
	  lines were modified.
	- Changed "showBuffers" command to display all buffers except macros if
	  n == -1 so that hidden buffers created by the user are included.
	- Changed "nextBuf" and "prevBuf" commands to include hidden, non-macro
	  buffers when switching if n == 0.
	- Renamed "pipeBuf" command to "filterBuf", changed its binding from
	  "C-x |" to "C-x v", and changed its prompt from "|" to "Filter
	  command" to clarify that it runs a shell command, not a pipeline.
	- Changed $KeyPending system constant to keyPending? function.
	- Changed "selectBuf" command and all buffer and file commands that use
	  "selectBuf" numeric prefix options to return one of three values in
	  script mode: (1) - if n == -1, name of buffer that was popped if not
	  deleted afterward; otherwise, nil; (2) - if n == 0, two-element array
	  containing buffer name and Boolean value indicating whether the buffer
	  was created (as was returned previously for "findFile" and "viewFile"
	  commands); or (3) - four-element array containing same first two
	  elements as for n == 0 plus ordinal number of window displaying the
	  buffer, and Boolean value indicating whether the window was created.
	- Removed buffer name and filename return values from "appendFile",
	  "insertBuf", "insertFile", "truncBuf", and "writeFile" commands, which
	  were not needed.
	- Changed "pause" function to get the delay time from the value given as
	  an argument instead of using the numeric prefix, and interpret the
	  argument as seconds or centiseconds, depending on the n argument.
	- Changed "setWrapCol" command to set the wrap column to the value given
	  as an argument instead of using the numeric prefix, or optionally set
	  it to the previous value, depending on the n argument.
	- Changed text insertion and replacement:
		. Changed "space", "insertSpace", and "newline" commands to
		  insert space(s) or newline(s) without formatting or text
		  replacement if n < 0.
		. Changed "openLine" command to move point to first empty line
		  inserted if n < 0.
		. Changed "quoteChar" command to do character replacement
		  instead of insertion if the "Over" or "Repl" buffer mode is
		  enabled.
		. Changed self-insert command to force insertion when n < 0.
	- Created $ScreenCount system variable, which returns the number of
	  existing screens.
11. Made screen and window improvements:
	- Changed "joinWind" command to join windows upward by default (like
	  "deleteWind") and delete buffer in other window if n == -1.
	- Changed "resizeWind" command to allow a negative argument and to grow
	  or shrink window at top instead of bottom in that case.
	- Renamed "redrawScreen" command (ESC l) to "reframeWind" and changed to
	  center current line in window when n == 0 (the new default) instead of
	  forcing a screen redraw.
	- Renamed "newScreen" command to "selectScreen" and changed to either
	  switch to a given screen, create a screen, or force a screen redraw,
	  depending on the n argument.
	- Created "selectWind" (C-x w) command, which switches to a given
	  window, and changed binding of "resizeWind" command to "C-x z".
	- Changed "nextScreen", "prevScreen", "nextWind", and "prevWind"
	  commands to switch to next or previous screen or window n times,
	  instead of using n as a screen or window number to switch to.
	- Changed "deleteScreen" command to require the screen number as an
	  argument in script mode, and also allow the current screen to be
	  deleted.
	- Created "bufWind" function, which returns ordinal number of first
	  window on current screen displaying given buffer, or nil if none.
	- Created "saveScreen" and "restoreScreen" functions and changed
	  "restoreWind" and "restoreScreen" to return the number of the restored
	  window or screen.
12. Made macro changes:
	- Changed "renameFile" (C-x R) macro to rename a file on disk by
	  default, or rename the filename of a buffer instead if n argument.
	- Created "deleteFile" macro (C-x D) which deletes a file on disk by
	  default, optionally with "rm -rf" command, or deletes a buffer and its
	  associated file from disk if n > 0.
13. Changed window handling:
	- Expanded use of numeric prefix to include n == -2 and n < -2 for most
	  buffer and file commands so that a new (n >= 2) or existing (n <= -2)
	  window can be selected as the target of the buffer, instead of always
	  using an existing window (if available), as previously.  For example,
	  "C-u 2 C-x C-f" will always display the file that is found in a new
	  window.
	- When displaying a pop-up window, added ability to shift the display
	  left if needed to prevent line truncation; for example, when doing
	  file pathname completions.
	- Created "popFile" (C-h C-p) and "popBuf" (C-h p) commands, which
	  display a file or buffer in a pop-up window and accept options (like
	  left-shift long lines) for controlling how the window is displayed.
	- Changed "splitWind" command to return the ordinal number of new window
	  not containing point.
14. Improved handling of modes and buffer attributes:
	- Expanded "show" modes to include buffer modes.
	- Eliminated "alterDefMode" command, $defModes system variable, and
	  default buffer modes, which were not useful.
	- Eliminated $BufFlagXXX and $ModeXXX system constants, and $bufFlags
	  system variable.
	- Renamed $bufModes, $globalModes, $showModes system variables to
	  $BufModes, $GlobalModes, $ShowModes system constants and changed to
	  return arrays of mode names instead of integer bit masks.
	- Created bufAttr?, bufMode?, globalMode? and showMode?  functions,
	  which check if any or all given buffer attribute or mode arguments
	  (individual names or within an array) are set and return a Boolean
	  result.
	- Combined "hideBuf", "unhideBuf", and "unchangeBuf" commands into new
	  "alterBufAttr" (C-x a) command, which provides the ability to clear,
	  enable, or disable buffer attributes.
	- Changed the "alterXxxMode" commands:
		. Changed use of n argument so that all modes can be cleared,
		  or cleared then set, in addition to the previous
		  functionality.
		. Changed processing to allow an array (of strings) as an
		  argument in addition to a string argument.
	- Removed "Esc8" global mode, which was never full implemented.
	- Changed display system to show global modes on mode line at bottom of
	  screen only.
    Now all modes and buffer attributes are managed with keywords instead of bit
    masks.
15. Created "createBuf" hook, which is called whenever a permanent buffer is
    created (for example, by the "selectBuf" or "findFile" commands) and can be
    used to initialize buffer modes or attributes.
16. Changed macro declaration syntax to allow a minimum and maximum argument
    count to be specified (both of which are optional), including forms "macro
    name" and "macro name()" for "zero or more arguments" and "macro name(min,)"
    for "min or more arguments".
17. Changed processing to save hidden buffers (except macros) in addition to
    unhidden ones when multiple buffers are saved at once via "ASave" global
    mode, "saveBuf" command, or "quickExit" command.
18. Redesigned terminal-display subsystem:
	- Changed code which manages changes to the display to operate more
	  efficiently and minimize OS calls.
	- Eliminated "NoUpd" global mode, which is no longer needed.
	- Changed horizontal scrolling of the line containing point when "HScrl"
	  global mode is disabled to be done the same way as scrolling of all
	  lines when "HScrl" global mode is enabled, instead of the radical
	  jump-scrolling as was done previously.
	- Renamed $horzScrollCol variable to $HorzScrollCol and changed to be
	  read-only.
19. Changed default bindings of the following commands and macros to be more
    consistent with and distinct from related commands and to make use of the
    expanded binding table:
	bfFormatItem		C-h 1	->	ESC .
	bfFormatList		C-h ,	->	ESC L
	chDir			C-c .	->	C-c d
	cycleKillRing		C-x y	->	ESC y
	deleteBuf		C-x k	->	C-x C-b
	deleteMacro		C-x RTN	->	C-x @
	fenceWord		C-c f	->	ESC {
	insertLineI		ESC i	->	C-x i
	kmDeleteKeyMacro	C-c C-d	->	C-x K
	kmSaveKeyMacro		C-c C-s	->	ESC C-s
	kmSelectKeyMacro	C-c k	->	ESC K
	kmShowKeyMacros		C-h y	->	C-h K
	kmXeqKeyMacro		C-c e	->	ESC e
	let			C-x =		ESC =
	pwd			C-h .	->	C-h d
	readPipe		C-x @ ->	C-x ~
	renameBuf		C-x b	->	C-x B
	renameFile		C-x r	->	C-x R
	scratchBuf		C-x s	->	C-x #
	selectBuf		C-x C-b	->	C-x b
	setBufFile		C-x f	->	C-x F
	seti			C-x i	->	ESC i
	showModes		C-h o	->	C-h M
	showPoint		C-x .	->	C-h .
	showScreens		C-h s	->	C-h S
	unbindKey		C-x C-k	->	ESC C-k
    and deleted duplicate bindings:
	C-c {	copyFencedRegion
	C-h {	killFencedRegion
	C-x {	deleteFencedRegion
20. Made several bug fixes:
	- Fixed bug where a ++, --, or assignment operation was causing a "not
	  an lvalue" error when the expression in question was being evaluated in
	  a "false" state; for example, "false and x[1] += 3".
	- Fixed a problem where an expression such as "$searchPat = 'ab[cd]:r'"
	  was evaluating to "ab[cd]" instead of the original pattern.
	- Fixed problem where an extra newline was being inserted when $lineText
	  was set to a new value.
	- Fixed bug where the search pattern was not being saved properly when
	  the pattern was a null string.
	- Fixed bug where the prompt for the "queryReplace" command could be
	  shown as '"?' if a regular expression pattern matched several lines in
	  the buffer.
	- Changed "selectBuf" command to return an error if n < 0 (pop request)
	  and the target buffer does not exist.
	- Fixed bug in "wrapLine" command and when 'Wrap' buffer mode was
	  enabled where a word at the end of a line that ended just prior, at,
	  or just beyond the wrap column was being wrapped when it shouldn't be
	  or was not being wrapped when it should.
	- Fixed bug where a function key could not be used as a single key; for
	  example, as $searchDelim.
	- Fixed bug where reading a file that did not exist would sometimes not
	  cause an error (but just create an empty buffer).
	- Fixed bug where the mode line at the bottom of the screen was not
	  being updated if a "deleteScreen" command caused the current screen
	  number to change.
	- Changed all places where a string is converted to an integer to ignore
	  any trailing white space in the source string instead of considering
	  the numeric literal invalid.
	- Fixed bugs where a nil value in a script could be processed as a
	  string under certain conditions, potentially causing a crash.
	- Changed hook processing so that any value returned from the "preKey"
	  hook will be ignored, and the current key will always be executed,
	  whether or not it was changed by the hook.  This prevents a potential
	  deadlock situation where no key entered by the user would be executed,
	  including the "exit" (C-x C-c) command, if the hook returned true for
	  every key entered.
21. Linked binary with new ProLib 1.3.0 library, which provides the ability to
    prepend text to a string-fab object, parse switches and values from the
    command line, and create and manage arrays and hash tables.

----------
8.5.1	23 Feb 2017
 1. Fixed bug where specifying a string containing a printf formatting spec
    (like "%s") as an argument to the "abort" or "exit" command or "notice"
    function in a script would cause unpredictable results, including a crash.
 2. Changed search commands to display a message when a search is "taking
    awhile" to complete (which can happen in very large buffers) so the user
    knows the search is in progress.
 3. Fixed problem where the "queryRepl" command was not always terminating if
    n > 0 and n substitutions were made because the number of matches was being
    checked instead of the number of substitutions.
 4. Fixed problem where a window was not being redrawn when "HScrl" mode was
    enabled, the display was shifted left (because the point was near the end of
    a long line), and "HScrl" mode was subsequently disabled.

----------
8.5.0	2 Feb 2017
 1. Converted GeekLib library to new ProLib library which contains several
    improvements, including Datum objects (which replace Value objects and now
    support several data types) and records and routines for managing arrays.
    Datum and Array objects are used extensively by MightEMacs.
 2. Enhanced supported data types:
	- Added array data type.
	- Changed nil and Boolean pseudo (string) types to real types.
    The scripting language now supports nil, Boolean, integer, string, and array
    data types.  Arrays may be nested, sliced, and "auto extended" by assigning
    a value to an element beyond the end of the array.  Array syntax is
    "[val,val,...]" where "val" is a value of any type, including array; for
    example, "x = [false,5,['abc',nil]]".  A slice is created by using two
    indices; for example, "y = x[0,2]" would set "y" to "[false,5]".
    Additionally, an array may be "auto extended" by assigning a value to an
    element beyond the end of the array; for example (continuing the previous
    one), the sequence "y[3] = 'xyz'" would set "y" to "[false,5,nil,'xyz']".
 3. Added a "for" statement (loop block) to the scripting language for iterating
    through elements of an array.  The new syntax is:
	for <var> in <array-expr>
		...
	endloop
 4. Changed macro syntax and argument processing:
	- Changed syntax for a macro definition to:
		macro <name>(<n>) {usage: <str>, desc: <str>}
	  which specifies that the (optional) argument count now be in
	  parentheses instead of preceded by a comma as previously, and adds
	  optional "usage" and "description" strings.
	- Changed showBindings display to include any usage text for macros.
	- Changed showKey command to display usage text on the message line in
	  addition to the command or macro name.
	- Replaced $ArgCount, $argIndex variables and "nextArg" function with
	  new $ArgVector array, which holds the arguments (if any) of a running
	  macro.
	- Changed numeric variables ($1, $2, ...) to reference $ArgVector array
	  elements.
	- Changed "length" function to accept an array argument and return its
	  size.
    Note that the $ArgVector variable may not be assigned to; however, the array
    it contains may be modified in any way, just like any other array.
 5. Implemented parallel assignment:
	- Added support for assignment expressions such as "a,b[1],c = [1,2,3]",
	  which will set multiple variables (or array elements) at once to the
	  elements of an array.
	- Removed support for comma expressions such as "(x = 3), y = nil" to
	  avoid syntactical ambiguities.
 6. Added array recursion detection:
	- Renamed $maxRecursion variable to $maxMacroDepth and created
	  $maxArrayDepth variable.
	- Changed certain array operations to either (a), return an error if
	  $maxArrayDepth is exceeded during recursive evaluation; or (b) stop if
	  endless recursion is detected and return "[...]" for the array.
	- Changed "quote" function to force the latter behavior if n > 0.
    These changes will prevent an endless loop if an array that contains itself
    at any nesting level is evaluated.
 7. Added support for line continuation in scripts: changed script processor to
    combine any line that ends with a backslash (\) with the following line(s)
    before evaluating it.  This allows any line (or multiple lines) in a script
    to be extended to the next line by adding a backslash to the end of it,
    including a line containing a partial single (') or double (") quoted
    string.
 8. Made several function changes:
	- Removed delimiter argument from include? function and changed to
	  require an array instead of a list.
	- Renamed push, pop, shift, unshift functions to strPush, strPop,
	  strShift, strUnshift and changed to not allow Boolean (or array)
	  arguments.
	- Created new push, pop, shift, and unshift functions which operate on
	  an array.
	- Changed "length" function to accept an array or string argument and
	  return its size or length.
	- Changed the concatenation operators (& and &=) and functions which
	  concatenate a list of arguments (like "print"), to also accept Boolean
	  values and arrays and process the latter (recursively) as if each
	  element was specified as an argument.
	- Changed "quote" function to accept any data type and convert it to a
	  string form which can be resolved via the "eval" function back to its
	  original value.
	- Changed "join" and "toString" functions to accept arrays and use the n
	  argument to control the conversion process.
	- Replaced $KillText variable with "kill N" function, which returns the
	  Nth kill.
	- Replaced int? and string? functions with type?, which returns the type
	  of its argument as a keyword ("nil", "bool", "int", "string", or
	  "array").
	- Changed "sprintf" function to accept an array at any position in the
	  argument list after the format spec and process the array elements as
	  if they were specified individually.
	- Created "split" function which converts a string to an array.
	- Created "array" function which creates an array with size and
	  initializer options.
	- Created "clone" function which creates an exact copy of an array.
	- Replaced void? function with empty?, which returns true if its
	  argument is nil, a null string, or an empty array.
	- Changed "sprintf" function and '%' operator to allow a nil argument
	  for the %s specification in the format string.
    Note that for compatibility with array elements, which can be assigned to
    but are not variables, the functionality of the strShift and strPop
    functions has changed slightly: a null item at the beginning (for strPop) or
    end (for strShift) of a delimited string in a variable or array element will
    not be detected, and nil will be returned instead of a null string as
    before.  The old behavior can be mimicked however, simply by "doubling up"
    the delimiter at the end of the string.  For example, use "a:bb::" in place
    of "a:bb:" to get a null string as the third argument for strShift instead
    of nil.
 9. Changed "rand" function:
	- Added "max N" required argument to function;
	- Changed to return integers in range 1..N.
	- replaced internal algorithm with a "xor-shift-64" type which uses
	  64-bit unsigned integers.
	- Changed $randNumSeed assignment so that (a), any value other than zero
	  is used verbatim; and (b), a zero value causes a new seed to be
	  obtained using the current time.
10. Made command changes:
	- Changed default key binding for "inserti" command to "C-c i" and
	  replaced deleteTab command with deleteBackTab (S-TAB) and
	  deleteForwTab (M-TAB), which simplifies the task of deleting tabs
	  forward when using soft tabs.
	- Changed "beep" command to a function.
	- Changed nextBuf and prevBuf commands to return buffer name only if n
	  == 0, and delete exited buffer after switching to new buffer if n < 0.
	- Changed resizeWind to make all windows on screen the same size if
	  n == 0.
	- Changed deleteWind to force space to upper window if n < -1 (instead
	  of n < 0) and added option to delete its buffer if n == -1 (for
	  consistency with prevBuf and nextBuf commands).
	- Created "lastBuf" command (bound to "C-x \"), which (a), switches to,
	  in the current window, the last buffer that was exited from in any
	  window; and (b), deletes the former buffer if n < 0.
    The "lastBuf" command provides a means to easily toggle between two buffers
    in a window, or view a file in the current window temporarily, then switch
    back to the previous buffer, deleting the new buffer in the process.
11. Changed "joinLines" command:
	- Fixed bug where all lines from dot to the end of the buffer would be
	  joined if n == 0 and the region contained only one line.
	- Changed processing to do nothing (instead of returning an error) if
	  n == 1 or the region line count is 1.
12. Made system variable changes:
	- Replaced $BufList and $WindList variables with "bufList" and
	  "windList" functions (which return arrays instead of delimited
	  strings) and added list options which can be selected via the n
	  argument.
	- Deleted $BufCount (which is synonymous with "length bufList()") and
	  $BufOtpDelim (which is not needed).
	- Replaced $BufLen and $BufSize variables with "bufSize" function which
	  returns the buffer size in lines or bytes, depending on the n
	  argument.
	- Replaced $EditorName, $EditorVersion, $Language, and $OS variables
	  with "sysInfo" function which returns a value selected by the n
	  argument.
	- Renamed $travJumpSize to $travJump (to be consistent with $horzJump
	  and $vertJump) and changed default value from 14 to 12.
	- Deleted $BufFlagPreprocd.
	- Eliminated legacy "truncated file" concept and corresponding buffer
	  flag ($BufFlagTruncated).
13. Changed concatenation:
	- A concatenation expression such as "nil & 5" where nil is the first
	  value is no longer allowed.
	- Any value may now be concatenated with a string, including Boolean and
	  array values.
	- Any value may be concatenated with an array; however, an array value
	  will be "exploded" first.
    These changes allow expressions such as "'Result: ' & myMac() & [': ',55]"
    (string result) and "[1,2] & [3,4,5]" (array result).
14. Changed auto-save feature:
	- Changed key entry loop to save all changed buffers instead of just the
	  current one when auto-save is triggered.
	- Changed mode control system to not allow "ASave" mode to be activated
	  if $autoSave is zero.
15. Changed hook system to no longer allow a command to be bound to a hook
    (which made no sense):
	- Changed wrapWord command to a function.
	- Created "wrapper" macro (in memacs.mm) which calls wrapWord, and set
	  it to the "wrap" hook.
16. Changed buffer completion to not display hidden buffers when TAB is entered
    as the first character, but include them if '?' is entered.
17. Made improvements to the C, MightEMacs, and Ruby toolbox libraries,
    including the ability to search for class and module names in Ruby files
    (via "C-c C-c") in addition to method names.
18. Changed default key binding for xeqFile command from "M-/" to "C-x /" to be
    consistent with other file commands and xeqBuf command (C-x x).
19. Streamlined command and function code so that execution is always done in
    one place and arguments are validated consistently.  These changes fixed
    bugs where specifying an unexpected integer argument to certain commands or
    functions caused a crash, including:
	- First argument to "joinLines" and "sprintf" functions.
	- First or second argument to "wrapLine" command.
	- Any argument to "deleteBuf" command.
20. Fixed issue where the "writeBuf" function would not always insert text in
    the correct place if the target buffer was being displayed.
21. Reorganized source header files: replaced the e*.h files with bind.h, cmd.h,
    english.h, exec.h, file.h, lang.h, main.h, search.h, std.h, and var.h.

----------
8.4.0	23 Oct 2016
 1. Changed internal line delimiters from CR to NL:
	- Changed all terminal input to allow either "return" (C-m) or "newline"
	  (C-j) as a line delimiter if either one is specified as the delimiter,
	  and to convert "return" to "newline" by default otherwise.
	- Changed all buffer editing to create a line when a NL character is
	  inserted instead of a CR character.
	- Changed pattern matching to recognize NL as "end of line" instead of
	  CR.
 2. Changed expression evaluation so that a null string ('' or "") will evaluate
    to true instead of false when used in a Boolean context.  Now the only
    expressions that are false are 0, false, and nil.  All other expressions,
    including a null string, are true.
 3. Changed "replace" and "queryReplace" commands to interpret a "\0" literal in
    the replacement pattern in Regexp mode as a "group 0" (the entire match)
    reference instead of a "0" character.
 4. Changed "deleteBuf" command to:
	- Ignore changes when n < 0 instead of n > 0.
	- Delete all unchanged buffers if n == 0.
	- Delete all buffers, no force, if n == 1.
	- Delete all buffers, ignoring changes, if n > 1.
    The user is prompted for confirmation in the last case.
 5. Changed "white space" delimiter in list processing from nil to a space
    character:
	- Changed push and unshift functions to convert a nil delimiter to a
	  null string instead of a space when adding the delimiter and value to
	  a variable.
	- Changed pop and shift functions to process a nil delimiter the same
	  way as a null ("") delimiter.
	- Changed include?, pop, and shift functions to use a space character
	  for white space instead of nil.
 6. Changed default $execPath to ":/usr/lib/memacs" (Debian) and
    ":/usr/local/lib/memacs" (non-Debian) and changed installation process
    accordingly.
 7. Removed "echo" option from "getKey" function and changed it to get a single
    key and return it as an integer if n <= 0.
 8. Changed the "writeFile" and "appendFile" commands to update the buffer name
    by default when a new filename is set, but to skip the update if n <= 0.
 9. Eliminated if/loop nesting limit in scripts.  Nesting depth is now
    unlimited.
10. Changed processing of "about" command and all "showXXX" commands so that if
    the buffer that is created is not deleted after the command is executed (if
    n >= 0), the buffer is made visible.
11. Added case-insensitive search option to "grepFiles" (C-x C-g) macro.
12. Fixed bug in "showMarks" command where a mark set on an empty line was
    sometimes displaying random characters or incorrect data for the line's
    contents.
13. Previously, when the "$otpDelim" variable was not set and multiple buffers
    were written, the input record delimiter from the current buffer was being
    used as the output delimiter for all buffers instead of using each buffer's
    input delimiter.  This has been fixed.
14. Fixed bug where assignment to the $bufLineNum variable was returning an
    error.
15. Removed the "reverse" function, which had dubious value.

----------
8.3.1	18 Sep 2016
 1. Bug fixes:
	- Fixed bug where it was not possible to specify an explicit RegExp
	  pattern that ended with a colon due to a syntax issue related to
	  consecutive colons.  For example, the pattern "abc:::r" was
	  interpreted as the plain text pattern 'abc::r' instead of RegExp
	  pattern /abc:/.  Changed method of interpreting patterns as follows:
	  "If a pattern ends with a colon followed by one or more valid option
	  letters, and the colon is not the first character of the pattern, then
	  everything preceding the colon is the pattern.  In all other cases,
	  the entire string is the pattern (with no options)."  Now for example,
	  "abc:ri" would be interpreted as RegExp pattern /abc/i, "abc:r:p"
	  would be interpreted as plain text pattern 'abc:r', and "abc::r" would
	  be interpreted as RegExp pattern /abc:/.
	- Fixed bug in "include?" function where it was returning false when the
	  element being searched for was in the list but also occurred earlier
	  in the list as a substring of a different element.
	- Fixed bug in "sub" function where it would return an incorrect result
	  in certain circumstances when called with a RegExp pattern and n > 1.
	- Fixed the "renameFile" (C-x r) macro and "help" (ESC ?) command by
	  changing all occurrences of the obsolete "fileExists?" function in
	  memacs.mm to equivalent "stat?" calls.
	- Fixed issues in the keyboard macro toolbox (keyMacro.mm) where saving
	  a macro (C-c C-s) produced an error and displaying a list (C-c y) did
	  nothing.
 2. Renamed $search and $replace system variables to $searchPat and $replacePat,
    which better describe their purpose.
 3. Renamed $WorkDir system variable to $workDir and changed its usage so that
    the current working directory can be changed by assigning a value to it.
 4. Replaced "Rd1st" global mode with -N switch.
 5. Changed default bindings for grepFiles macro from "M-s" to "C-x C-g",
    cFindFunc, memacsFindMacro, and rubyFindMethod macros from "M-C-]" to
    "C-c C-f", and newScreen command from "M-C-s" to "M-s", which puts the first
    in the "file family" (most of which begin with "C-x") and makes the latter
    ones easier to enter and/or remember.
 6. Added option to "renameFile" (C-x r) macro to rename file on disk only if
    n <= 0.
 7. Changed fenceWord macro to accept any punctuation character as a fence (in
    addition to (), [], {}, and <> pairs) and use it for both the left and right
    fence characters.

----------
8.3.0	18 Jun 2016
 1. For Debian Linux: changed default value of $execPath global variable to
    ":/etc/memacs.d:/etc" in memacs binary, and changed installation process to
    install package files in /etc and /usr/bin instead of /usr/local.
 2. Made regular expression changes:
	- Added support for "{m,n}" repetition operators, "\b" (word boundary),
	  and "\B" (non-word boundary) metacharacters.
	- Changed RE compilation to return an error if a repetition operator
	  (such as + or *) is specified in an invalid location, instead of
	  treating the operator as a literal character, as was done previously.
 3. Made mode changes:
	- Replaced single-letter shortcuts for mode names with name completion.
	  Partial mode names which are unambiguous (such as "rd" for "RdOnly")
	  are also allowed.
	- Created "showModes" command bound to "C-h o", and removed cryptic mode
	  information from "showBuffers" display.
 4. Changed "insertLineI" command to use its numeric prefix to determine a
    target line and insert a single line with indentation before that line
    instead of inserting n lines before or after the current line, as was done
    previously.

----------
8.2.1	22 Apr 2016
 1. Bug fixes:
	- Fixed bug where all integer global variables were being converted to
	  strings after the "showVariables" command was executed.
	- Fixed bug where the "setBufFile" command was returning an error
	  message when RETURN was entered at the filename prompt instead of
	  clearing the filename.
	- Fixed bug where all marks were cleared in a narrowed buffer when the
	  "clearBuf" command was executed, instead of just the visible ones.
 2. Renamed the "fileExists?" function to "stat?" and changed to accept a second
    argument containing letter(s) which mimic the shell's -x file tests.  The
    function now returns true if any of the following test codes are true for
    the given file: [d]ir, [e]xists, [f]ile, sym[L]ink, hard[l]ink, [r]ead,
    [s]ize > 0, [w]rite, or [x]eq; otherwise, it returns false.
 3. Changed the "pathname" function to not resolve a symbolic link and return
    the abolute pathname of the link itself if n <= 0.
 4. Added calls to the exit-buffer and enter-buffer hooks if the buffer changes
    when switching screens.
 5. Added new macros to the memacs.mm startup file:
	- "renameFile" (bound to 'C-x r'), which renames the file associated
	  with the current buffer, both in the editor and the OS.
	- "nextGrepBuf" (bound to 'C-c ]'), and "prevGrepBuf" (bound to
	  'C-c ['), which switch to the next or previous buffer from the
	  result of the most recent "grepFiles" invocation.
 6. Changed the user startup file .memacs to create a write hook which will
    check if the file that is about to be written already exists and is a
    symbolic or hard link.  If so, it will ask the user if the link should be
    broken before writing, thereby preserving the original file.
 7. The Red Hat Linux binary has been replaced with an equivalent one built on
    CentOS Linux, and a new Debian Linux binary is now included.

----------
8.2.0	11 Mar 2016
 1. Made search and replacement changes:
	- Search and replacement patterns may now be any length.
	- Options (formerly ":m") which are appended to a search pattern have
	  been expanded and now apply to non-Regexp patterns as well.  New
	  options are: "i" (ignore case), "e" (exact case), "r" (Regexp mode),
	  and "p" (plain text mode).  Also changed pattern parsing so that a
	  pattern such as "x:e" can be searched for literally by using a double
	  colon, as in "x::e".  Pattern options override the global modes
	  'regexp' and 'exact', so you may now perform any type of search (or
	  search and replace) by appending option(s) to the pattern instead of
	  adjusting the global modes first.  The two global modes are now used
	  as defaults only.
	- Escape characters \t (tab), \r (CR), \n (NL), and \f (FF) are now
	  available for use in regular expression search and replacement
	  patterns.
	- Escape characters \d (digit), \l (letter), \s (space), and \w (word)
	  are now available for use in regular expression character classes.
	- Escape characters \A (beginning of string), \D (non-digit), \L
	  (non-letter), \S (non-space), \W (non-word), \Z (end of string, but
	  before a CR), and \z (end of string) are now available for use in
	  regular expression search patterns.
	- Fixed ^ and $ processing so that they will match adjacent to an
	  imbedded CR character in a buffer line or string in addition to the
	  beginning or end of it.
	- Operators =~ and !~ may now be used in an expression to perform
	  regular expression matching.  The second (string) argument is assumed
	  to be a regular expression which may contain groups.
	- Changed the "index" and "sub" functions to operate in Regexp mode
	  and/or ignore case when ":r" and/or ":i" is appended to the pattern;
	  otherwise, plain text, case-sensitive mode.  Also changed "sub" to do
	  zero substitutions if n == 0, one substitution if n == 1 or is the
	  default, and all substitutions if n > 1.
	- Changed the "match" function to return groups from the last =~ or
	  "index" match by default, and from the last buffer search if an n
	  argument is given.
	- Changed $Match variable to return the last pattern match, whether from
	  a buffer search or a =~ match.
	- Renamed $ModeRegExp variable to $ModeRegexp to be consistent with the
	  global mode of the same name.
	- Modified regular expression search and replacement in a buffer or
	  string so that a match and replacement of an empty string without
	  advancement of the scanning position will cause processing to stop
	  (with an error message), and prevent an endless loop.
 2. Changed mark system so that it is more usable:
	- Replaced numeric marks with printable-character marks between ' ' and
	  '~' inclusive, and changed so that marks are tied to a buffer instead
	  of a window.  As a result, the same marks will exist in every window
	  that is displaying the same buffer.
	- Mark ' ' (space) is now the default mark and is used to define
	  regions.
	- Renamed "clearMark" command to "deleteMark" and added option to delete
	  all marks (except ' ') in the current buffer if an n argument is
	  specified.
	- Changed "setMark" and "swapMark" commands to use mark ' ' by default,
	  '.' if n < 0, and prompt for a mark otherwise.
	- Changed "gotoMark" to always prompt for a mark and changed its default
	  binding to 'M-SPC'.
	- Changed the "deleteMark", "gotoMark", and "swapMark" commands so that
	  existing marks are included in the prompt when requesting a mark
	  interactively.
	- Created "showMarks" command for displaying all the marks in the
	  current buffer in a pop-up window.
	- Changed the "defined?" function to check whether a mark exists and
	  (optionally) is also active, dependent on the n value.
    Now marks can be any printable character, are easier to remember, are tied
    to a buffer instead of a window, and can be displayed at any time.
 3. Made key binding syntax and related changes:
	- Renamed "xPrefix", "cPrefix", and "hPrefix" commands to "prefix1",
	  "prefix2", and "prefix3", respectively, and eliminated the "X-", "C-",
	  and "H-" prefixes for these commands.
	- Two-key sequences are now coded as two values separated by a space.
	- Control characters may now be coded as 'C-x' in addition to the
	  current '^x' form, although the new syntax is now preferred -- to be
	  consistent with 'M-' and 'S-' prefixes.
	- The escape, backspace, tab, and return keys may now be coded as 'ESC',
	  'DEL', 'TAB', and 'RTN' (in addition to 'SPC' for the spacebar) and
	  are now the preferred form for those characters.
	- Lower-case letters are now favored over upper case; for example, "C-a"
	  instead of "C-A".
	- Added all prefix pseudo commands and special ones like "universalArg"
	  to the "showBindings" display and the "bindKey" completion display,
	  and changed the "defined?" function to return "pseudo command" for all
	  of these commands.
 4. Added variable name completion, which is automatically enabled whenever a
    variable name is requested at a prompt (such as entering "C-x =" to set a
    variable) or by specifying the 'V' or 'v' type to the "prompt" system
    function (see first bullet in item #8).
 5. Created "fenceWord", "popFileList", and "showVar" macros and added to
    memacs.mm startup file (see memacs-macros.1 for details).  Also fixed issue
    where language tools were not always loaded or unloaded appropriately in
    certain situations when switching buffers.
 6. Made command changes:
	- Created "dupLine" command, which duplicates a block of lines in the
	  current buffer and places the cursor at the beginning of the
	  duplicated text.
	- Added option to "deleteWhite" command to delete non-word characters in
	  addition to white space if n > 0.
	- Changed "gotoLine" command to get the line number as its first
	  argument and operate on a specified buffer if an n argument is given.
	- Changed the "readFile" and "setBufFile" commands' default behavior to
	  change the current buffer name to one derived from the filename.
	- Changed "backWord", "forwWord", and "endWord" commands to return false
	  if move goes out of buffer; otherwise, true.
	- Changed "clearBuf" command to require a buffer name if n >= 0 and
	  force-clear if n != 0 so that the current buffer can be force-cleared
	  in a script via "-1 => clearBuf".
 7. Changed screen formatting such that a nearly complete mode line is displayed
    when the column width is between 80 and 95 columns instead of an abbreviated
    one as previously.
 8. Removed leading "!" character from directive names used in scripts and
    changed syntax so that a left paren may immediately follow the name (with
    the exception of the "macro" directive).  As a result, you may now for
    example, use "if(a == 1)" or "while x > 0" instead of "!if a == 1" and
    "!while x > 0" as before.
 9. Made system function changes:
	- Swapped the third ("delimiter") and fourth ("type") arguments of the
	  "prompt" function and changed it to process a fourth argument only if
	  not a completion type.  Also changed prompt types to [^]no auto,
	  [b]uf, [c]har, [f]ile, [s]tr, and [v|V]ar, where 'V' specifies all
	  variables and 'v' specifies mutable-only variables.
	- Changed "readBuf" function to use its n argument as a repeat count and
	  return the last line read.
	- Removed "pad" function, which can be done instead with the "%"
	  formatting operator or the "sprintf" function.
	- Changed "subLine" and "subString" functions so that the last argument
	  ("len") is optional and defaults to an infinite value.
	- Fixed bug in "subString" function where a negative offset that was
	  equal to the string length (such as "subString('abc',-3,3)" returned a
	  null string instead of a substring beginning at the first character.
	- Changed "dirname" function to return "." instead of null when the
	  pathname argument has no directory portion and an n argument is
	  specified.
	- Changed "whence" command to display information about the current line
	  instead of the whole buffer if an n argument is specified.
	- Changed "insert", "overwrite", "replaceText", and "writeBuf" functions
	  to insert CR characters literally if n < 0.
	- Created "void?" function which return true if its argument is nil or a
	  null string.
	- Created wordChar? system function, which returns true if a character
	  is in $wordChars.
	- Changed "push" and "unshift" functions to return the new variable
	  value instead of the argument value.
10. Replaced hook variables with new commands: "setHook" and "showHooks".  Also
    created "chDir" hook, which is invoked at program startup and whenever the
    current directory is changed.
11. Aliases may now be created for system functions as well as for commands and
    macros.
12. Made system variable changes:
	- Changed $BufSize variable to return the number of lines in the current
	  buffer instead of bytes, and created $BufLen, which returns the former
	  (bytes) value.
	- Changed $lineChar variable to return a string instead of an integer.
	- Replaced "bufWind" function with $WindList variable, which provides
	  more information about current windows.
13. Added -S switch which provides a means to execute a MightEMacs script
    contained in a file as a shell script.  All command line arguments are
    passed to the MightEMacs script.
14. Removed length restriction from keyboard macros and fixed issue where a
    keyboard macro would stop after one iteration if the $maxLoop variable was
    set to zero, instead of executing n times.
15. Removed "kecho" global mode and $ModeKeyEcho variable, and changed the
    "prompt" and "getKey" functions to suppress key echoing if the n argument is
    zero.
16. A \s (space) escape character is now recognized in a double-quoted string,
    and \b (backspace) has been removed.
17. The return value from the "exitBuf" hook (or nil if it is not defined) is
    now passed as an argument to the "enterBuf" hook, and both hooks are now
    called on hidden buffers, which were bypassed previously.
18. Changed handling of true, false, and nil in scripts:
	- In most cases, nil is now translated to a null string when converted
	  to a string, and Boolean values may not be converted and will generate
	  an error.
	- Moved the functionality of the "stringLit" function to "toString" and
	  deleted the former function.
	- Changed the "toString" function to (a), convert integer, string, and
	  nil values by default (and generate an error if Boolean); (b), accept
	  any type of value and convert it to human-readable form if n is not
	  the default; and (c), put double quotes around the result if n > 0 and
	  the original value was a string.
	- Changed the "print" function to always output "true" and "false" for
	  Boolean values and either a null string (default), or "nil" (if
	  n <= 0) for nil.
19. Fixed issue where windows other than the current window that were all
    displaying the same buffer were not restored to their original state if the
    buffer was narrowed and then widened.
20. Fixed some other minor bugs.

8.1.1	14 Nov 2015
 1. Fixed various bugs, including an issue where entering a right brace in the
    first column of a line when C mode was enabled could cause random text to be
    deleted before the cursor; and an issue where backspacing did not work
    correctly if the cursor had previously moved past the right edge of the
    terminal window.
 2. Changed the license for the project to GNU General Public License (GPLv3).

----------
8.1.0	25 Oct 2015
 1. Created "undelete" command, which restores the most recently deleted text
    from a deleteXXX or truncBuf command, and bound it to M-U.
 2. Renamed $loopMax variable to $maxLoop and created $maxRecursion variable,
    which sets the maximum recursion depth for any macro to prevent endless
    recursion and an "out of memory" crash.
 3. Changed the bang (!) to a carat (^) in the -G and -D switches to avoid
    conflicts with the shell's use of the bang character.
 4. Changed default architecture to 64 bit.
 5. Changed joinLines command to join lines with no space between them (instead
    of a single space) when invoked in a script with a nil argument, and created
    a corresponding macro (joinLines0) bound to X-^ so it can be used
    interactively.
 6. Fixed some minor bugs.
 7. Simplified the installation procedure.

----------
8.0.0	29 Sep 2015
 1. First public release.
