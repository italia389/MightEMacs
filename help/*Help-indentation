~bTabs and Indentation~B

MightEMacs supports both "hard" and "soft" tabs for indenting lines.  When hard
tabs are in effect, tab characters are inserted into the text when the ~utab~U key
is pressed, and lines are displayed with tabs converted to spaces using the
value of the $hardTabSize system variable to determine the tab stops.  When soft
tabs are in effect, space characters are inserted into the text using the value
of the $softTabSize system variable to determine the tab stops.

The current tabbing method is determined as follows: if $softTabSize is zero,
hard tabs are in effect; otherwise, soft tabs.  You can enable soft tabs by
using the ~blet~B (~#uESC =~U) command to set the value of the $softTabSize variable to
a positive number.  Or alternately and more simply, specify a numeric prefix
that is zero or negative and press the ~utab~U key.  This will set the $softTabSize
variable to the negated value of the number that you entered.  For example,
~#uC-- 4 tab~U will set $softTabSize to 4.

When hard tabs are used (which is the default), you can simply insert or delete
tab characters in the text to change the indentation.  The point will jump to
the next tab stop when it is moved past a tab character.  When soft tabs are
used however, spaces are inserted so you must use the ~bforwTab~B (~#uESC C-f~U) or
~bbackTab~B (~#uESC C-b~U) command to get the same behavior.  However, these commands
are infrequently used when coding.  A more common occurrence is the need to
delete a tab that was just entered.  As it turns out, the ~udelete~U key is bound to
the ~bbackspace~B command, which automatically deletes the previous soft tab when
soft tabs are in effect (via the ~bdelBackTab~B command).  So pressing ~udelete~U is
usually all that is required.

Note that tab settings are maintained separately for each screen, so if a
different screen is selected, the tab settings for the new screen will be put
into effect.

Following are all the commands that are used for managing tabs and indentation:

    ~#uTAB~U         tab             Insert hard or soft tab n times (or set soft tab
                                size to abs(n) if n <= 0).

    ~#uESC )~U       indentRegion    Indent lines in region by n tab stops
                                (default 1).
    ~#uESC (~U       outdentRegion   Outdent lines in region by n tab stops
                                (default 1).

    ~#uC-x C-d~U     detabLine       Change hard tabs to spaces in [-]n lines
                                (default 1, region lines if n == 0).  Tab size
                                is specified as first argument.  If nil,
                                $hardTabSize is used.
    ~#uC-x C-e~U     entabLine       Change spaces to hard tabs in [-]n lines
                                (default 1, region lines if n == 0).  Tab size
                                is specified as first argument.  If nil,
                                $hardTabSize is used.
    ~#uESC C-b~U     backTab         Move point backward [-]n tab stops (default 1).
    ~#uESC C-f~U     forwTab         Move point forward [-]n tab stops (default 1).

    ~#uS-TAB~U       delBackTab      Delete backward [-]n hard or soft tabs
                                (default 1).
    ~#uESC TAB~U     delForwTab      Delete forward [-]n hard or soft tabs
                                (default 1).

Of these commands, ~bindentRegion~B and ~boutdentRegion~B are probably the most
commonly used (other than the ~utab~U key itself).  These two commands change the
indentation of all lines in the current region.  The steps to indent or outdent
all region lines are as follows:

     1. Move the point to the beginning or end of the block of lines you wish to
        indent or outdent.  (It can be anywhere on the line.)
     2. Type ~uC-SPC~U to set mark ' '.
     3. Move the point to the other end of the line block; that is, the first or
        last line of the block.
     4. Type ~#uESC )~U or ~#uESC (~U to indent or outdent the line block one tab stop.
        To indent or outdent more than one tab stop, enter a numeric prefix
        first; for example, ~#uC-u 3 ESC )~U.
