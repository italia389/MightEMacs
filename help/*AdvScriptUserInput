~bUser Input~B

It is possible to get user input from a script by using the ~bprompt~B function,
which displays a prompt on the message line, reads a response, and returns the
result.  When using the function, note the following:

  * It accepts zero to three arguments in the following order:

         1. A prompt string, which may be ~unil~U or a null string.
         2. One or more options in a string argument, specified as comma-
            separated keywords of form "keyword" or "keyword: value".
         3. A default value, which may be ~unil~U, a character, an integer, or a
            string (including a null string), depending on the prompt type.

  * All arguments are optional.  If none are given, the user is prompted for
    input with no prompt string displayed.

  * Options of the first form are:

        NoEcho              Do not echo key(s) that are typed.
        NoAuto              Suppress auto-completion.
        TermAttr            Enable terminal attributes in prompt string.

  * Keyword options are:

        Delim: ~ukey-lit~U      Specify an input delimiter in the same format as a
                            key literal.  This option must be the last option
                            specified.  All text following the colon that
                            remains in the string argument, including any
                            comma(s), are assumed to be part of the key literal.

        Type: ~ut~U             Specify one of the following input types for ~ut~U:
                                Buffer          Buffer name completion.
                                Char            Single character.
                                DelRing         Delete ring access.
                                File            Filename completion.
                                Key             One key.
                                KeySeq          One key sequence.
                                KillRing        Kill ring access.
                                Macro           Macro name completion and ring
                                                access.
                                Mode            Mode name completion.
                                MutableVar      Variable name completion,
                                                mutable only.
                                ReplaceRing     Replace ring access.
                                RingName        Ring name completion.
                                SearchRing      Search ring access.
                                String          String (default).
                                Var             Variable name completion,
                                                mutable and immutable.

  * The prompt string may be nil or a null string for a null prompt; otherwise,
    the following steps are taken to build the prompt string that is displayed:

         1. If the prompt string begins with a letter, a colon and a space
            (": ") are appended to the string; otherwise, it is used verbatim,
            however any leading ' or " quote character is stripped off first
            (which forces the rest of the string to be used verbatim) and any
            trailing white space is moved to the very end of the final prompt
            string that is built.
         2. If a non-empty default value is specified, it is displayed after the
            prompt string between square brackets [ ] if the prompt type is
            "Char", and must be an ASCII character in that case; otherwise, it
            must be a string or int and is stored in the input buffer in string
            form as the initial value.
         3. A key literal is returned for types "Key" and "KeySeq"; otherwise,
            if the user presses just the delimiter key, the default value (if
            specified) is returned as an ASCII character if prompt type is
            "Char"; otherwise, nil is returned.
         4. If the user presses C-SPC at any time, a null string is returned
            instead (or a null character if the prompt type is "Char");
            otherwise, the string in the input buffer is returned when the
            delimiter key is pressed.

  * If the "TermAttr" option is specified, terminal attributes are enabled in
    the prompt string that is displayed on the message line.

  * If the "NoEcho" option is specified, characters are not echoed during input;
    however, line editing and navigation keys may still be entered (in the
    blind) and will have their usual effect.

  * If the prompt string begins with a letter, a colon and a space are appended
    to the string before the user is prompted for input; otherwise, the prompt
    string is used as is.  However, any leading quote character (~u'~U or ~u"~U) is
    stripped off first and any trailing white space is moved to the very end of
    the final prompt string that is built.  Hence, the addition of the ": "
    string may be suppressed by prepending a quote character to any prompt
    string beginning with a letter.

  * If the prompt type is "Key" or "KeySeq", a single keystroke (for "Key") or a
    key sequence (for "KeySeq") is read and returned verbatim in key-binding
    format, including ~uRTN~U and ~uC-SPC~U.  If the prompt type is not "Key" or
    "KeySeq", the following rules apply:

          - If a non-nil default value is specified (including a null string),
            it is displayed after the prompt string between square brackets [ ]
            if the prompt type is "Char", and must be an ASCII character in that
            case; otherwise, it must be string or integer and is stored in the
            input buffer in string form as the initial value to be returned.
            The default value may also be specified as ~unil~U for none (the
            default) or simply omitted.

          - A key literal is returned for types "Key" and "KeySeq"; otherwise,
            if the user enters just the delimiter key, the default value is
            returned as an ASCII character if it exists and the prompt type is
            "Char"; otherwise, ~unil~U is returned.  If the user presses ~uC-SPC~U at
            any time, a null string is returned instead (or null character ?\0
            if the prompt type is "Char"); otherwise, the string in the input
            buffer is returned when the delimiter key is entered.

  * The "Type" option specifies the type of input, as follows:

        Buffer          Enable buffer name completion during input.
        Char            Read a single character (one keystroke) and return it as
                        an 8-bit integer.  ~uC-q~U, ~uRTN~U, ~uC-j~U, and ~uC-SPC~U can be
                        quoted with ~uC-q~U to enter the key in raw form.
        DelRing         Enable delete ring access during input.
        File            Enable filename completion during input.
        Key             Read one keystroke and return it verbatim in key
                        binding format.
        KeySeq          Read one key sequence and return it verbatim in key
                        binding format.
        KillRing        Enable kill ring access during input.
        Macro           Enable macro name completion and macro ring access
                        during input.
        Mode            Enable mode name completion during input.
        ReplaceRing     Enable replace ring access during input.
        RingName        Enable ring name completion during input.
        SearchRing      Enable search ring access during input.
        String          Read a string without completion (the default).
        Var             Enable variable name completion during input and
                        include all system and global variables.
        MutableVar      Enable variable name completion during input and
                        include all system and global variables except read-only
                        system variables and global variables that begin with a
                        capital letter.

    In addition, the "NoAuto" option can be specified to disable auto
    completion, which causes the function to wait for the delimiter to be
    entered before returning.

  * The portion of the message line from the end of the prompt string (if any)
    to the right edge of the screen is the "input area".  The cursor will stay
    in this area at all times during input.  The input line will be
    automatically scrolled right or left as needed to keep the cursor in view as
    characters are entered or the cursor is moved.  If the line is scrolled to
    the left, a ~u$~U character will appear at the beginning of the input area as an
    indicator.  Likewise, if the input text extends beyond the right edge of the
    screen, a ~u$~U character will appear at the end of the input area.  Supported
    line editing and navigation keys are:

        ~uC-b~U or ~uleft-arrow~U           Move cursor backward one character.
        ~uC-f~U or ~uright-arrow~U          Move cursor forward one character.
        ~uC-a~U                         Move cursor to beginning of line.
        ~uC-p~U or ~uup-arrow~U             If prompt type is a ring access type,
                                    replace input with next "older" entry from
                                    the corresponding ring (the top entry);
                                    otherwise, move cursor to beginning of line.
        ~uC-e~U                         Move cursor to end of line.
        ~uC-n~U or ~udown-arrow~U           If prompt type is a ring access type,
                                    replace input with next "newer" entry from
                                    the corresponding ring (the bottom entry);
                                    otherwise, move cursor to end of line.
        ~uDEL~U                         Delete backward one character.
        ~uC-d~U                         Delete forward one character.
        ~uC-u~U                         Erase line.
        ~uC-k~U                         Delete text from cursor to end of line.
        ~uC-q~U                         Quote next character entered; that is, read
                                    it verbatim.
        ~uTAB~U                         Perform a completion on current text if a
                                    completion prompt type was specified;
                                    otherwise, insert a tab character.
        ~uC-SPC~U                       Erase line and return a null character
                                    result (?\0) if prompt type is "Char";
                                    otherwise, return a null string result ('').

  * An input delimiter may be specified with "Delim: ~ukey-lit~U" when the prompt
    type is not "Key" or "KeySeq" (and as explained previously, this option must
    be the last one specified).  The key literal can be "RTN", which specifies
    the default delimiter (the ~ureturn~U key), or a different key (for example, the
    ~uesc~U key, coded as "Delim: ESC") so that ~ureturn~U can be entered as part of the
    input string.
