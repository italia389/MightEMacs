When working with multiple buffers (or files), it is often useful to split the
screen into two or more windows and display the buffers in separate windows.
This is accomplished with the "splitWind" (~#uC-x 2~U) command, which splits the
current window into two windows of equal size by default.  The sizes can be
different however, by using a numeric prefix.

Initially, the current buffer is attached to both windows, which can be useful
for displaying different portions of it.  To display a different buffer in one
of the windows, simply switch to it with the "nextBuf", "prevBuf", or
"selectBuf" command.  The entire process may then be repeated to create
additional windows.

The next obvious question is, "How do we adjust the sizes of each window?"
There are three commands for this:

    resizeWind      ~#uC-x z~U
    growWind        ~#uC-x +~U
    shrinkWind      ~#uC-x -~U

These commands set, increase, or decrease the current window size by the number
of rows specified with the numeric prefix.

To switch to another window, use:

    selectWind      ~#uC-x w~U       Switch to a window by number (topmost is 1).
    nextWind        ~#uC-x n~U       Switch to next window (below), wrapping around
                                to top if necessary.
    prevWind        ~#uC-x p~U       Switch to previous window (above), wrapping
                                around to bottom if necessary.

You can also scroll an adjoining window without switching to it via:

    forwPageNext    ~#uESC C-v~U     Scroll next window forward n pages.
    backPageNext    ~#uESC C-z~U     Scroll next window backward n pages.
    forwPagePrev    ~#uC-h C-v~U     Scroll previous window forward n pages.
    backPagePrev    ~#uC-h C-z~U     Scroll previous window backward n pages.

There are commands for deleting windows as well:

    delWind         ~#uC-x 0~U      Delete the current window.
    joinWind        ~#uC-x j~U      Join the current window with the window above it.
    onlyWind        ~#uC-x 1~U      Delete all windows except the current one.

Lastly, there are three commands for reframing a window; that is, scrolling the
lines in a window up or down without changing the point position:

    moveWindDown    ~#uC-x C-n~U    Move the window frame down n rows.
    moveWindUp      ~#uC-x C-p~U    Move the window frame up n rows.
    reframeWind     ~#uC-x .~U      Reframe the window so that the line containing
                               point is at the [-]nth row, or vertically
                               centered if n is zero (the default).

All the window commands can be more finely controlled with a numeric prefix.
For example, scrolling can be done in half pages by using a negative numeric
prefix.  See the "showKey" (~#uC-h ?~U) or "showCommands" (~#uC-h c~U) help descriptions
for details.
