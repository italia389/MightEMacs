~bKill Ring~B

As you may recall, a text object is saved in the kill ring whenever it is copied
or killed.  The "yank" (~uC-y~U) command is used to insert text from the kill ring
into the current buffer at point.  The yanked text is also marked as a region.

There are five other related commands that you can use to manage the kill ring:

    yankCycle           ~#uESC C-y~U
    revertYank          ~#uC-x C-y~U
    cycleKillRing       ~#uC-c k~U
    delKillEntry        ~#uC-x k~U
    showKillRing        ~#uC-h k~U

To yank the most recent kill, press ~uC-y~U.  If you want a kill before that,
immediately press ~#uESC C-y~U (yankCycle) one or more times.  Each time you execute
the "yankCycle" command, the last inserted kill text is replaced with the
previous one.  It also cycles the kill ring so that the last kill inserted stays
at the "top".  You can also cancel the whole operation by pressing ~#uC-x C-y~U
(revertYank) right after the "yank" command or after any of the "yankCycle"
commands.  If ~#uC-x C-y~U is entered, the inserted text will be removed and you
will be back to where you started.

The "cycleKillRing" command allows you to cycle the kill ring manually before
yanking.  This is handy when you have two or more kills and want to insert each
one in a different place.  Move to the first location and insert the last kill
first (~uC-y~U), move to the next location, cycle the kill ring (~#uC-c k~U), then insert
the next one (~uC-y~U).

Another way to do this is to use a negative numeric prefix with "yank" to access
older kills directly.  In the last example, you could skip the "cycleKillRing"
command and insert the next to last kill via ~#uC-- C-y~U.

To see the kill ring at any time (in a pop-up window), enter ~#uC-h k~U.  The most
recent kill is number 0, followed by -1, -2, etc.

If you want to delete one or more kills from the kill ring, use "delKillEntry"
(~#uC-x k~U).  This command deletes the most recent n entries (default 1), a specific
entry if n is negative, or all entries if n is zero.

Lastly, the maximum size of the kill ring (which defaults to 50 entries) is
controlled with the "ringSize" (~#uESC R~U) command.  To change the size, execute
the command with a numeric prefix, enter "kill" for the ring name, and a enter a
new integer value.  To set it to an unlimited size, enter zero for the size.
Note that you cannot set the size to a value (other than zero) that is less than
the current number of entries in the kill ring.  You must delete one or more
entries first.
