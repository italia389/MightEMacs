~bUndeleting Text~B

As you may recall, deleted text is saved on the "delete ring" (with the
exception of single characters or a whole buffer).  The delete ring works just
like the kill ring and can be used in the same manner.

The commands for undeleting text and managing the delete ring are:

    undelete            ~#uESC u~U
    undeleteCycle       ~#uESC U~U
    revertYank          ~#uC-x C-y~U
    cycleDelRing        ~#uC-c d~U
    delDelEntry         ~#uC-x d~U
    showDelRing         ~#uC-h d~U

The "undelete" (~#uESC u~U) command is equivalent to the "yank" (~uC-y~U) command and the
"undeleteCycle" (~#uESC U~U) command is equivalent to the "yankCycle" (~#uESC C-y~U)
command.  The only difference is that text is retrieved from the delete ring
instead of the kill ring.

So if you delete some text by mistake, like a line or word, you can immediately
restore it by pressing ~#uESC u~U.  The inserted text is also marked as a region.  If
you want the deleted text before that, immediately press ~#uESC U~U one or more
times to replace the restored text with the next older entry from the delete
ring.  You also can cancel the whole undelete process by pressing ~#uC-x C-y~U
(revertYank), which will remove the undeleted text from the buffer, just like is
done when the keys are entered after a yank command.

The maximum size of the delete ring is initially 30 entries, and is controlled
with the "ringSize" (~#uESC R~U) command.  To change the size, execute the command
with a numeric prefix, enter "delete" for the ring name, and enter a new integer
value.  To set it to an unlimited size, enter zero for the size.
