~bUndeleting Text~B

Whenever text is deleted, other than single characters or a whole buffer, it is
saved on the "delete ring".  The delete ring works just like the kill ring; that
is, deleted text is "pushed" on to the ring so that the most recent deletion is
always the first one to be restored.

The ~bundelete~B (~#uESC u~U) command is used to insert text from the delete ring into
the current buffer at point.  If you delete some text by mistake, like a line or
word, you can immediately restore it by pressing ~#uESC u~U.  The inserted text is
also marked as a region, just like for the ~byank~B (~uC-y~U) command.

There are several commands for using and manipulating the delete ring, which are
explained in Advanced Help.  For now, you just need to remember that deleted
text is automatically saved, and ~#uESC u~U restores the most recently-deleted text
at point.
