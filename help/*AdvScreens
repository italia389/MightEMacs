~bScreens~B

In addition to windows, MightEMacs provides the option of creating multiple
screens to manage buffers and directories.  A screen is the entire display,
containing all visible windows.  Multiple screens directly overlap each other
(so only one may be viewed at a time) and are numbered, beginning at 1.  If
multiple screens exist, the number of the current (frontmost) one is displayed
in the mode line of the bottom-most window.  Also, each screen maintains its own
working directory, tab settings, and wrap column.  Whenever a screen is
selected, the current directory, tab settings, and wrap column will be changed
automatically if different than the previous screen.

For example, let's say you typed the following command to start the editor:

    $ mm myscript.ms

At startup (usually), the first file is displayed in a single window on screen
number 1.  Now say you entered ~#uC-x 2~U to create another window, then pressed ~uC-v~U
to move the point so the windows had different "looks" (on the same buffer).  If
you then typed ~#uESC s~U and entered zero at the prompt to create another screen,
you would see that a second screen is created with just one window, and the
window's mode line would contain "S2/2", indicating "screen 2 of 2".

Now say you pressed ~#uC-c D~U and changed the current directory to "..", then
pressed ~#uC-x C-f~U to find a file and entered filename "Notes.txt".  Screen 2 would
be displaying buffer "Notes.txt" in the parent directory at this point.  If you
used ~bselectScreen~B (~#uESC s~U), ~bnextScreen~B (~#uESC ]~U) or ~bprevScreen~B (~#uESC [~U) to switch
back to screen 1, you would notice that the first screen looks exactly as it did
before and the original working directory would be displayed on the message
line, indicating that it is now the current directory.  This technique is very
useful for keeping your places in various windows, buffers, and directories and
quickly switching among them.  You can create as many screens as you like.

Whenever a screen is created, the current directory is associated with the
screen, and the hard tab size, soft tab size, and wrap column are set to user-
defined default values (regardless of what they were set to in the previous
screen).  If no default values are defined, the hard tab size, soft tab size,
and wrap column are set to 8, 0, and "screen width - 4", respectively.  You can
change any of these defaults in a script with the ~bsetDefaults~B function.  You can
also obtain the current default settings in a script via "getInfo 'Defaults'",
which returns the values in an array.  See the ~bshowFunctions~B (~#uC-h f~U) display for
details.

Note that when a file is read into a buffer, the current directory is associated
with that buffer and remembered.  The directory is considered to be the buffer's
"home" directory.  The buffer is also associated with the current screen as well
because the screen has the same home directory.  This homing feature allows for
multiple files to be opened in the same directory (in the same screen) and be
associated with each other.  Moreover, you can switch to the next or previous
home buffer by using a positive numeric prefix with the ~bnextBuf~B (~#uC-x [~U) and
~bprevBuf~B (~#uC-x [~U) commands, and also delete all of the buffers as a group when you
are done working on them.  The deletion can be done by specifying the "Homed"
option to the ~bdelBuf~B (~#uC-x C-b~U) command, or can be done at the same time the
screen is deleted by using a negative numeric prefix with the ~bdelScreen~B (~#uESC
C-d~U) command (described below).

The complete list of screen commands follows:

    selectScreen    ~#uESC s~U      Switch to a screen by number.  If the number is
                               zero, create a new screen, assign the next
                               available sequential number as its identifier,
                               and switch to it.
    delScreen       ~#uESC C-d~U    Delete a screen by number (which may be the
                               current screen) and renumber any other higher
                               numbered screens to "fill the hole".  If n < 0,
                               all buffers "homed" to the screen are also
                               deleted.
    nextScreen      ~#uESC ]~U      Switch to the next (sequentially higher numbered)
                               screen n times.
    prevScreen      ~#uESC [~U      Switch to the previous (sequentially lower
                               numbered) screen n times.
    showScreens     ~#uC-h S~U      Display a list of all screens with their working
                               directories, window numbers, buffer names, and
                               filenames in a pop-up window.  An asterisk (*) is
                               shown before the buffer name if the buffer has
                               been modified.

See the individual command descriptions in the ~bshowKey~B (~#uC-h ?~U) or
~bshowCommands~B (~#uC-h c~U) help displays for more details.

There is also a command called ~bgetFile~B (~#uC-x C-g~U) available that finds a file
and opens it in a new screen in one step.  It also will set the file's buffer to
read-only if n <= 0.
