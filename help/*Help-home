Welcome to the MightEMacs Help System.  Topics are listed below.  To get help on
a particular topic, move the cursor to the link at the beginning of the topic
line and press ~#uC-h g~U.  Links are words in angle brackets, like this: <keys>
The cursor may be on any character in the link.

~uC-h~U means "control h"; that is, hold down the ~ucontrol~U key and press the ~uh~U key.
Therefore, you would hold down ~ucontrol~U and press ~uh~U, let go, then press the
letter ~ug~U for ~#uC-h g~U, which will go to the topic associated with the link the
cursor is on.

Standard links on every help page are:

<home>              Go to home page (this page).
<exit>              Exit the Help System and return to editing session.

To exit MightEMacs at any time, press ~#uESC e~U or ~#uC-x C-c~U.

It is highly recommended that first-time users go through the ~bMightEMacs~B
~bTutorial~B, which is a "hands on" document that you open directly in the editor.
As you read through the tutorial, you practice using the keys that you learn in
each lesson by typing them and editing the text.  The tutorial teaches you the
basics of navigating, editing text, moving text around, search and replace, etc.
To open the tutorial at any time (or resume one you already started), press
~#uC-h t~U.

To display the MightEMacs "cheat sheet"  at any time, press ~#uC-h e~U.  To return to
your editing session, press ~#uC-h e~U again.
