~bBinding and Unbinding Keys~B

As was discussed previously in the ~bKeys and Key Bindings~B section, any key or key
sequence can be bound to a system or user command, including the printable
characters like letters (each of which are bound separately by case), digits,
and punctuation characters.  And when you type a key or key sequence, the
command that it is bound to is executed.  By default, the printable keys (except
the spacebar) are bound to the "self insert" pseudo-command and thus, insert one
copy of themselves into the text when typed.  Non-printable keys and key
sequences however, have no default action and will generate an error if typed
when not bound to anything.  Additionally, if an executed key or key sequence
returns a Boolean ~ufalse~U value, any running macro is stopped and "False return"
is displayed on the message line.  (Macros are discussed in the ~bKey Macros~B
section.)

Generally, all key bindings used during an editing session are either built-in
or are set in startup files.  You can change them interactively, however.  To
create a key binding, enter:

    ~#uESC k~U       ~#ubindKey~U

You will be prompted for the key sequence and command name to bind it to.  To
delete a key binding, enter:

    ~#uESC C-k~U     ~#uunbindKey~U

You will be prompted for the key sequence to unbind.  To bind or unbind a single
key, use a numeric prefix that is negative or zero.

Recall that the ~#uC-h c~U (~#ushowCommands~U) command displays all system and user
commands that match a pattern and their key bindings.  Also, "showKey" (~#uC-h ?~U)
shows what a particular key sequence is bound to and "showBindings" (~#uC-h n~U)
shows all possible key bindings that match a pattern and what they are bound to.

See the ~bKey Binding Syntax~B section for the use and syntax of key bindings in
coded string form (for use in a script).
