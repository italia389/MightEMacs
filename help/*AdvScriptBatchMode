~bMScript Shell Scripts~B

An MScript script may be invoked in a number of different ways, including from
the shell command line using a "@filename" argument (see memacs(1) for details).
You can take this concept one step further by executing a script file directly
from the shell; that is, instead of typing:

    $ memacs ... @myscript ...

you can just type:

    $ myscript ...

at the shell command prompt.  This is accomplished by specifying the pathname to
the "memacs" binary with the ~b-S~B switch in the first line of the file as a shell
comment (a "shebang" line); for example:

    #!/usr/local/bin/memacs -S
    # Example script that can be executed from the shell.
    readFile $1
    markBuf
    0 => trimLine
    beginBuf

This script will open the file specified as an argument, read it into the
current buffer, trim white space from all lines, then move the point back to the
beginning of the buffer.  When the script ends, control is passed back to the
user.

Note that any arguments specified on the command line are available to the
script as $1, $2, ..., etc.  And when the script starts, the current buffer is
"unnamed".
