~bKeys and Key Bindings~B

As illustrated in the ~bIntroduction~B section, MightEMacs takes some form of action
for each keystroke that you type.  It is a "modeless" editor; that is, every key
or key sequence that is entered invokes an action, including inserting
characters.  There is not an "insert mode" that you must enter to insert text,
and exit to enter commands.  You are essentially always in "command mode".

Characters are inserted into the current buffer generally by pressing any of the
printable character keys (letters, numbers, and punctuation characters) as you
would expect, as well as a few special keys, like ~utab~U and the spacebar.  What's
really happening behind the scenes however, is that each of those keys are
invoking the "self insert" pseudo-command because each key is "bound" to that
command.  Consequently, when you press the letter ~ux~U for example, MightEMacs
looks up the "key binding" for the ~ux~U key, discovers that it is bound to "self
insert", and runs that command (which inserts one copy of itself into the text
by default).  If you had pressed ~uC-f~U instead, it would have matched the key to
the ~bforwChar~B command, and would have executed that command instead (which
moves the cursor one character forward).

So it is important to remember that all keys are bound to a command (either
built-in or user-defined, discussed later), and the bound command is executed
when the key is pressed.  As it turns out, two keys are often required to be
entered in sequence in order to invoke a command.  And if two are required, the
first one is always ~uESC~U (metaPrefix), ~uC-x~U (prefix1), ~uC-c~U (prefix2), or ~uC-h~U
(prefix3).  Additionally, if the second keystroke is a letter, case is
significant.  A two-key binding is referred to as a "key sequence" and the first
key is the "prefix key".  (The prefix keys can be rebound to keys other than the
defaults shown above if desired.  Binding and unbinding keys are discussed in
Advanced Help.)  All key bindings in MightEMacs are either one or two
keystrokes.

Note that if a letter key is bound to a command, it is bound separately by case;
that is, lower case ~ua~U is a different key than upper case ~uA~U.  And as was
mentioned previously, the printable keys (except the spacebar) are bound to the
"self insert" pseudo-command and thus, insert one copy of themselves into the
text when typed, by default.  Non-printable keys and key sequences however, have
no default action and will generate an error if typed when not bound to
anything.

Note also that the ~uesc~U key is the default "meta prefix" key in MightEMacs, which
was entered on old keyboards by holding down the ~umeta~U key while pressing another
key.  Although modern keyboards often have another key that can be substituted
for the ~umeta~U key (like ~ualt~U), MightEMacs does not currently support this for
portability reasons, so the ~uesc~U key is used instead, as a separate keystroke.
Meta key bindings such as ~#uESC k~U can be coded in MScript as ~uM-k~U in keeping with
the old tradition, where the "M" stands for "meta".  However, the preferred
syntax is ~#uESC k~U and they will always be shown in the editor and this Help System
in the latter form.

Lastly, there is a special command that you need to be aware of sooner rather
than later.  It is the ~babort~B command, bound to ~uC-g~U ("control g").  You can
press ~uC-g~U at almost any time to abort an operation in MightEMacs, similar to
pressing ~uC-c~U in the shell.
