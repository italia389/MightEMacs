~bFile Commands~B

In our examples thus far, we have used two file commands: ~bsaveFile~B and
~bfindFile~B.  There are several other file commands as well.  The file commands
provide various ways to read and write files and manage their associated
buffers.  The complete list follows:

    appendFile      ~#uC-x C-a~U     Prompt for a filename (waiting for ~ureturn~U to be
                                entered when completing the name) and append the
                                current buffer to the given file.  The filename
                                is ~bnot~B attached to the buffer to prevent
                                accidental overwrite of the file if the buffer
                                is subsequently modified and saved.
    delFile         ~#uC-x D~U       Delete a file on disk, or a buffer and its
                                associated file.
    findFile        ~#uC-x C-f~U     Prompt for a filename (waiting for ~ureturn~U to be
                                entered when completing the name if the numeric
                                prefix is 0 or 1) and find the file.  Check
                                pathnames associated with existing buffers
                                first, then files on disk.  Switch to the
                                existing buffer if found; otherwise, create a
                                buffer, switch to it, and read in the file from
                                disk.
    insertFile      ~#uC-x C-i~U     Insert a file from disk into the current buffer
                                at point, without moving point if n is zero, and
                                mark inserted text as a region.
    linkFile        ~#uC-x L~U       Create a hard link or symbolic link to a file.
    readFile        ~#uC-x C-r~U     Read a file from disk into the current buffer,
                                replacing its contents, and clear the "Changed"
                                attribute.
    renameFile      ~#uC-x R~U       Rename a file entered at a prompt, or one
                                associated with a buffer.
    saveFile        ~#uC-x C-s~U     Write the current buffer to its associated file,
                                overwriting the file if it already exists.
    viewFile        ~#uC-x C-v~U     Find a file in the same manner as the findFile
                                command, but also enable the "ReadOnly" buffer
                                attribute.
    writeFile       ~#uC-x C-w~U     Prompt for a filename (waiting for ~ureturn~U to be
                                entered when completing the name), write the
                                current buffer to the given file, and attach the
                                filename to the buffer (unless the numeric
                                prefix is negative or zero).  If the file
                                already exists, you will be prompted for
                                confirmation before it is overwritten.
    xeqFile         ~#uC-x /~U       Search for a file with the ~bxPathname~B function,
                                then execute the file that is found as a user
                                routine in the same manner as the ~bxeqBuf~B
                                command.

Note that any filename argument may contain "~~/" or "~~user/" at the beginning
of the pathname or "$var" or "${var}" anywhere in the pathname to specify the
current user's HOME directory, a specific user's HOME directory, or an
environmental variable, which will be automatically expanded if possible.

If an OS error occurs when reading or writing a file, the operation will be
aborted and an error message will be displayed on the message line.
