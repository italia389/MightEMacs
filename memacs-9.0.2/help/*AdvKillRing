~bKill Ring~0

As you may recall, a text object is saved in the kill ring whenever it is copied
or killed.  The ~uyank~U (~uC-y~U) command is used to insert text from the kill ring
into the current buffer at point.  The yanked text is also marked as a region.

There are four other related commands that you can use to manage the kill ring:

   ~uyankCycle~U            ~#uESC C-y~U
   ~ucycleKillRing~U        ~#uC-c k~U
   ~udeleteKill~U           ~#uC-x k~U
   ~ushowKillRing~U         ~#uC-h k~U

To yank the most recent kill, press ~uC-y~U.  If you want a kill before that,
immediately press ~#uESC C-y~U (~uyankCycle~U) one or more times.  Each time you execute the
~uyankCycle~U command, the last inserted kill text is replaced with the previous one.
It also cycles the kill ring so that the last kill inserted stays at the "top".
You can also use ~uyankCycle~U to undo a previous ~uyank~U by invoking it with a zero
numeric prefix -- enter ~#uC-u C-u ESC C-y~U right after the ~uyank~U command and the
inserted text will be removed.

The ~ucycleKillRing~U command allows you to cycle the kill ring manually before
yanking.  This is handy when you have two or more kills and want to insert each
one in a different place.  Move to the first location and insert the last kill
first (~uC-y~U), move to the next location, cycle the kill ring (~#uC-c k~U), then insert
the next one (~uC-y~U).

Another way to do this is to use a negative numeric prefix with ~uyank~U to access
older kills directly.  In the last example, you could skip the ~ucycleKillRing~U
command and insert the next to last kill via ~#uC-_ C-y~U.

To see the kill ring at any time (in a pop-up window), enter ~#uC-h k~U.  The most
recent kill is number 0, followed by -1, -2, etc.

If you want to delete one or more kills from the kill ring, use ~udeleteKill~U
(~#uC-x k~U).  This command deletes the most recent n entries (default 1), a specific
entry if n is negative, or all entries if n is zero.

Lastly, the maximum size of the kill ring is controlled by the $killRingSize
system variable, which defaults to 40.  To change the size, set this variable to
a new integer value.  If it is set to zero, the kill ring is of unlimited size.
Note that you cannot set the $killRingSize variable to a value that is less than
the current number of entries in the kill ring.  You must delete one or more
entries first.
