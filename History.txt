8.1.1	14 Nov 2015
 1. Fixed various bugs, including an issue where entering a right brace in the
    first column of a line when C mode was enabled could cause random text to be
    deleted before the cursor; and an issue where backspacing did not work
    correctly if the cursor had previously moved past the right edge of the
    terminal window.
 2. Changed the license for the project to GNU General Public License (GPLv3).

8.1.0	25 Oct 2015
 1. Created "undelete" command, which restores the most recently deleted text
    from a deleteXXX or truncBuf command, and bound it to M-U.
 2. Renamed $loopMax variable to $maxLoop and created $maxRecursion variable,
    which sets the maximum recursion depth for any macro to prevent endless
    recursion and an "out of memory" crash.
 3. Changed the bang (!) to a carat (^) in the -G and -D switches to avoid
    conflicts with the shell's use of the bang character.
 4. Changed default architecture to 64 bit.
 5. Changed joinLines command to join lines with no space between them (instead
    of a single space) when invoked in a script with a nil argument, and created
    a corresponding macro (joinLines0) bound to X-^ so it can be used
    interactively.
 6. Fixed some minor bugs.
 7. Simplified the installation procedure.

8.0.0	29 Sep 2015
 1. First public release.
