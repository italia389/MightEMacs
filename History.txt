8.1.0	25 Oct 2015
 1. Created "undelete" command, which restores the most recently deleted text
    from a deleteXXX or truncBuf command, and bound it to M-U.
 2. Renamed $loopMax variable to $maxLoop and created $maxRecursion variable,
    which sets the maximum recursion depth for any macro to prevent endless
    recursion and an "out of memory" crash.
 3. Changed the bang (!) to a carat (^) in the -G and -D switches to avoid
    conflicts with the shell's use of the bang character.
 4. Changed default architecture to 64 bit.
 5. Changed joinLines command to join lines with no space between them (instead
    of a single space) when invoked in a script with a nil argument, and created
    a corresponding macro (joinLines0) bound to X-^ so it can be used
    interactively.
 6. Fixed some minor bugs.
 7. Simplified the installation procedure.

8.0.0	29 Sep 2015
