~bKill Ring~B

As discussed in the previous section, editing is generally done by manipulating
"text objects" in various ways.  There are three actions which may be performed
on text objects: delete, copy, and "kill".  Kill is the same as delete, except
that the text is saved before it is deleted.

Whenever a text object is copied or killed, it is saved in the "kill ring".  The
kill ring is an area of memory which can hold any amount of text in multiple
internal buffers, which are linked to each other in a circular fashion.  (The
number of buffers is determined by the $killRingSize system variable, which
defaults to 40.)  When a new kill occurs, previous kills are "pushed back" one
position around the ring so that the most recent kill is always the first one to
be retrieved.  If the ring is full, the oldest kill is discarded to make room
for the new kill.

The ~uyank~U (~uC-y~U) command is used to insert text from the kill ring into the
current buffer at point.  It inserts the most recent copy or kill by default.
The yanked text is also marked as a region.

There are several commands for using and manipulating marks, regions, and the
kill ring, which are explained in Advanced Help.  For now, you just need to
remember that ~uC-SPC~U sets the space mark at point for delineating a region, and
~uC-y~U inserts (yanks) the most recent copy or kill from the kill ring.
