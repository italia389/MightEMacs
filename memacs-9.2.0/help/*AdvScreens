~bScreens~B

In addition to windows, MightEMacs provides the option of creating multiple
screens to manage buffers.  A screen is the entire display, containing all
visible windows.  Multiple screens directly overlap each other (so only one may
be viewed at a time) and are numbered, beginning at 1.  If multiple screens
exist, the number of the current (frontmost) one is displayed in the mode line
of the bottom-most window.  Also, each screen maintains its own working
directory.  Whenever a screen is selected, the current directory will
automatically be changed if needed.

For example, let's say you typed the following command to start the editor:

    $ mm myscript.ms

At startup (usually), the first file is displayed in a single window on screen
number 1.  Now say you entered ~#uC-x 2~U to create another window, then pressed ~uC-v~U
to move the point so the windows had different "looks" (on the same buffer).  If
you then typed ~#uC-u ESC s~U to create another screen, you would see that a second
screen is created with just one window, and the window's mode line would contain
"S2", identifying the screen.

Now say you pressed ~#uC-c d~U and changed the current directory to "..", then
pressed ~#uC-x C-f~U to find a file and entered filename "Notes.txt".  Screen 2 would
be displaying buffer "Notes" in the parent directory at this point.  If you used
~uselectScreen~U (~#uESC s~U), ~unextScreen~U (~#uESC ]~U) or ~uprevScreen~U (~#uESC [~U) to switch back to
screen 1, you would notice that the first screen looks exactly as it did before
and the original working directory would be displayed on the message line,
indicating that it is now the current directory.  This technique is very useful
for keeping your places in various windows, buffers, and directories and quickly
switching among them.  You can create as many screens as you like.

The complete list of screen commands follows:

    ~uselectScreen~U    ~#uESC s~U      Switch to a screen by number.  If a positive
                               numeric prefix is specified, create a new screen,
                               assign the next available sequential number as
                               its identifier, and switch to it.  If a negative
                               or zero numeric prefix is specified, redraw
                               current screen instead.
    ~udeleteScreen~U    ~#uESC C-d~U    Delete a screen by number (which may be the
                               current screen) and renumber any other higher
                               numbered screens to "fill the hole".
    ~unextScreen~U      ~#uESC ]~U      Switch to the next (sequentially higher numbered)
                               screen n times.
    ~uprevScreen~U      ~#uESC [~U      Switch to the previous (sequentially lower
                               numbered) screen n times.
    ~ushowScreens~U     ~#uC-h S~U      Display a list of all screens with their working
                               directories, window numbers, buffer names, and
                               filenames in a pop-up window.  An asterisk (*) is
                               shown before the buffer name if the buffer has
                               been modified.

See the individual command descriptions in the ~ushowCommands~U display for more
details.
