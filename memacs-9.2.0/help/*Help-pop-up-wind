~bPop-Up Windows~B

As explained in the ~bDisplay Terminology~B section, buffers are displayed in
windows, which are areas of two or more lines on the screen, and may contain the
point where you can edit text.  There is another type of window however, called
a ~bpop-up window~B which also appears on the screen, but will never contain the
point, and only exists for a short time to display information.  When a pop-up
window is being displayed, the cursor will always be at a prompt at the bottom
of the screen and will remain there until the window is dismissed.  Pop-up
windows operate the same way as the "less" Unix command (file viewer) and
support a subset of its commands.

When you are viewing a pop-up window in MightEMacs, you can press ~u?~U to see the
commands that are available, which are all single keystrokes.  You can press the
letter ~uq~U or ~uESC~U at any time to dismiss the pop-up window and return to the edit
window.  If you press a key other than a paging command, it is "remembered" and
used as the first keystroke of the next command after the pop-up window is
dismissed.

Pop-up windows are used extensively by MightEMacs for many purposes, including
the display of help and state information by all of the "show" commands.  For
example, you can use the ~ushowVariables~U (~#uC-h v~U) command now to display a pop-up
window and figure out how to move around in it.  Remember that ~u?~U displays the
available commands and ~uq~U or ~uESC~U exits.
