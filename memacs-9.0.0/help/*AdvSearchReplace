~bSearching and Replacing~0

MightEMacs provides several commands for searching through text in a buffer and
also for replacing text that matches a pattern.  To search the current buffer
for a string that matches a pattern, the ~usearchForw~U (~uC-s~U) or ~usearchBack~U (~uC-r~U)
command is used.  You will be prompted to enter the pattern.  The pattern is
delimited by ~uESC~U by default so that ~uRTN~U can be entered as part of the pattern.
This can be changed however, by setting the $searchDelim variable to ~uRTN~U or a
different delimiter key.  If you set it to ~uRTN~U, you could then enter ~#uC-q C-j~U
to make a line delimiter (newline) part of the pattern.  (Note that ~#uC-q RTN~U
would not work because ~uC-q~U quotes characters literally during input and thus,
~#uC-q RTN~U would generate a "\r" character, not "\n".)

Once a pattern has been set, the ~uhuntForw~U (~uC-]~U) and ~uhuntBack~U (~uC-^~U) commands may
be used in any combination to search for the next or previous occurrence.  The
search pattern is saved in the "search ring" (if different than any other entry)
and in the $searchPat variable.

To find and replace text, the ~ureplace~U (~#uESC r~U) or ~uqueryReplace~U (~#uESC q~U) command is
used.  To replace a fixed number of occurrences of a pattern, specify a numeric
prefix to the ~ureplace~U command; otherwise, it will replace all occurrences from
the point to the end of the buffer.  The ~uqueryReplace~U command works like ~ureplace~U
but prompts for an action to take each time a match is found.  You can enter ~u?~U
at the prompt to get a list.  Actions include: skipping to the next occurrence,
undoing the last replacement and reprompting at that location, stopping and
returning to the starting point, and replacing all remaining matches without
prompting.  In all cases, either command will stop if a match is not found.  The
replace pattern is saved in the "replace ring" and in the $replacePat variable.

Search and replace patterns are remembered when new ones are entered
interactively or when patterns are set by assigning a value to the $searchPat or
$replacePat variable.  The patterns are saved in the search and replace rings in
the same manner as copied and killed text is saved in the kill ring, except that
duplicate entries are not saved to mitigate clutter.  You can recall a previous
pattern whenever you are being prompted to enter a pattern; that is, whenever
you invoke the ~usearchForw~U, ~usearchBack~U, ~ureplace~U, or ~uqueryReplace~U command
interactively.  The most recent pattern will be displayed initially.  To display
the previous one, you enter ~uC-p~U or ~uup-arrow~U.  When you do this, the ring is
cycled and the current entry is brought into the input buffer.  You may repeat
this process as often as you like to see the next older entries in sequence.
You may also cycle the ring in the opposite direction by entering ~uC-n~U or
~udown-arrow~U.  Once you have found the pattern you want, you can edit it or just
press the delimiter key as usual to execute the command.

You can view the search or replace ring at any time by entering ~#uC-h s~U
(~ushowSearchRing~U) or ~#uC-h r~U (~ushowReplaceRing~U).  You can also delete any or all
entries via the ~udeleteSearchPat~U (~#uC-x s~U) and ~udeleteReplacePat~U (~#uC-x r~U) commands,
which operate in the same manner as the ~udeleteKill~U (~#uC-x k~U) command.  See the
~ushowCommands~U (~#uC-h c~U) descriptions for details.

The maximum sizes of the search and replace rings are controlled by the
$searchRingSize and $replaceRingSize system variables, which both default to 20.
To change a ring size, set the corresponding variable to a new integer value.
If it is set to zero, the ring is of unlimited size.  Note that you cannot set
either variable to a value that is less than the current number of entries in
the corresponding ring.  You must delete one or more entries first.

There is one additional search and replace option: the ~uqueryReplaceAll~U macro
(~#uESC C-q~U).  This macro performs a ~uqueryReplace~U on every visible buffer in the
current editing session, pausing from one to the next to display results and
give you the option to continue or quit.  Additionally, it can be preceded by
the ~ugrepFiles~U macro (~#uC-x C-g~U) to open all files matching a shell glob pattern,
or only those matching the shell pattern and also containing a plain text
(fgrep) or regular expression (egrep) pattern.  This gives you the ability to
find files containing a pattern and then doing a mass search and replace on
those files interactively.  For the ~ugrepFiles~U macro, append ":r" to the pattern
to perform an RE search (enter ~#uC-h ? C-x C-g~U for details).  You may also leave
the search pattern blank (by pressing ~uESC~U at the prompt) to skip the "grep"
filtering.  Additionally, you may limit the buffers to search to just the ones
found by ~ugrepFiles~U by entering a negative numeric prefix to the ~uqueryReplaceAll~U
macro.  (The ~uqueryReplaceAll~U and ~ugrepFiles~U macros are loaded from the site
startup file "memacs.mm".)

Note that pattern match and replacement operations may also be performed via a
script on buffer lines or arbitrary text.  The ~u=~~~U and ~u!~~~U operators do RE
comparisons, the ~uindex~U function locates a plain text or RE pattern in a string,
and the ~usub~U function performs search and replace on a string using the specified
plain text or RE pattern.

Note also that when pattern matching is performed with the ~u=~~~U operator, the
~uindex~U function, or any of the search and replace commands, the string and groups
that are matched (whether in a buffer or a string) are available via the ~umatch~U
function.
