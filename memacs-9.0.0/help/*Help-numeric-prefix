~bNumeric Prefix~0

Much of the power of MightEMacs comes from the use of a "numeric prefix" with a
command, which is also referred to as the "n argument", mostly when writing
scripts.  A numeric prefix alters the default behavior of a command in some
manner, typically by specifying a direction (backward or forward) and/or a
quantity (a number of lines or repetitions, for example).

To illustrate this, let's do some navigation in this buffer.  Press ~#uESC f~U
(~uforwWord~U) and notice that the point moves one word forward.  Now press
~#uC-u ESC f~U.  The point moves two words forward.  Try ~#uC-u 5 ESC f~U or ~#uC-_ C-_ C-n~U
and see what happens.  You get the idea.  (Remember that ~uC-n~U is ~uforwLine~U and ~uC-p~U
is ~ubackLine~U.)

~uC-u~U provides (generally) a positive numeric prefix to a command and ~uC-_~U (~ucontrol~U
+ ~ushift~U + underscore) provides a negative one.  The general way to enter a
numeric prefix for a command (or macro) is to press ~uC-u~U and/or ~uC-_~U one or more
times before pressing the key(s) for the command.  The ~uC-u~U key is for positive,
increasing values (in the sequence 2,0,3,4,5,...) and the ~uC-_~U key is for
negative, decreasing values (in the sequence -1,-2,-3,...).  (Note that you can
generate the negative prefix by holding down the ~ucontrol~U key and pressing
~u-~U (dash) with or without the ~ushift~U key.)  You may also type digits directly, but
only immediately after the initial numeric prefix key.  Otherwise, the first
digit typed will be taken as a "command" and inserted into the text.  You may
also cancel the operation at any time by pressing ~uC-g~U (~uabort~U).

You may want to experiment with the numeric prefix keys now in combination with
some navigation keys (like the arrow keys).  It is important that you have a
good understanding of their use and purpose.  They are used extensively by the
editor.
