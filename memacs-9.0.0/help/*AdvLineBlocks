~bLine Blocks and Line Commands~0

As discussed in the ~bEssential Editing Commands~0 section, a numeric prefix may
be used for the ~ucopyLine~U, ~ukillLine~U, and ~udeleteLine~U commands to select a block
of contiguous lines to operate on.  This method of selecting lines is used by
several other commands as well which operate on line blocks.  Each of these
commands use the numeric prefix to select one or more adjacent lines as follows:

    n < 0       Select current line and abs(n) previous lines.
    n > 0       Select current line and n - 1 following lines.
    n == 0      Select all lines in current region.

The commands and macros that operate on line blocks are:

    ~ucopyLine~U        ~#uC-c C-l~U     Copy line block to kill buffer.
    ~udeleteLine~U      ~uC-l~U         Delete line block.
    ~udetabLine~U       ~#uC-x C-d~U     Change hard tabs to spaces in line block.
    ~udupLine~U         ~#uESC d~U       Duplicate line block and place point at
                                beginning of text of duplicated block.
    ~uentabLine~U       ~#uC-x C-e~U     Change spaces to hard tabs in line block.
    ~uindentLine~U      ~#uC-c )~U       Indent line block.  User is prompted for number
                                of tab stops if interactive.
    ~ujoinLines~U       ~#uESC C-j~U     Convert line block to single line with white
                                space between lines replaced with a single
                                space.
    ~ujoinLines0~U      ~#uC-x C-j~U     Convert line block to single line with white
                                space between lines deleted.
    ~ukillLine~U        ~#uC-h C-l~U     Delete line block and save to kill buffer.
    ~ulowerCaseLine~U   ~#uC-x l~U       Convert text in line block to lower case.
    ~uoutdentLine~U     ~#uC-c (~U       Outdent line block.  User is prompted for number
                                of tab stops if interactive.
    ~utitleCaseLine~U   ~#uC-x t~U       Convert words in line block to title case.
    ~utrimLine~U        ~#uC-x C-\~U     Trim white space from end of each line in line
                                block.
    ~uupperCaseLine~U   ~#uC-x u~U       Convert text in line block to upper case.
    ~uwrapLine~U        ~#uESC RTN~U     Rewrap lines in line block.

Additionally, the ~uwpJoinLines~U (~#uC-c C-j~U) and ~uwpWrapLine~U (~#uC-c RTN~U) macros, which
provide additional features, also operate on line blocks.  See the ~ushowMacros~U
(~#uC-h @~U) help display for details.
