~bCompletions~0

MightEMacs provides a very useful feature called "completions".  With few
exceptions, any time a command, alias, macro, buffer name, file pathname, or
variable name needs to be entered at a prompt, you can enter zero or more
characters of the name and press ~utab~U to see all the items that begin with those
characters in a pop-up window.  This can be repeated as many times as you like
by adding or subtracting characters and pressing the tab key again.  You may
also enter ~u?~U to see the matching items, the difference being that ~utab~U will
automatically extend the input string to the first character that differs among
the items, but ~u?~U will not.  If only one item matches, then the name is
"completed" when the tab key is pressed and, depending on the operation, either
the entire name is shown, waiting for you to press ~ureturn~U to continue; or the
entire name is displayed (briefly) and the operation is performed.

For example, say you want to search for a file to edit.  You can use the
~ufindFile~U command and look around.  Enter ~#uC-x C-f~U.  At the prompt, type part of a
file path and hit ~utab~U.  You should see matching filenames in a pop-up window.
(If nothing matches the characters you entered however, the window will be blank
and you will hear an audible beep.)  You can see all the files in the current
directory by pressing the tab key immediately after the prompt.  You can also
expand environmental variables, your home directory, or any user's home
directory by entering ~u$xxx/~U, ~u~/~U, or ~u~xxx/~U, respectively.

Note that if a multi-page pop-up window is being displayed while you are
completing a name and the first character you type happens to be a window-
navigation character (like ~uf~U for "next page"), it will be interpreted as such.
In this case, just press ~uESC~U or ~uq~U to dismiss the window, then continue typing
the name.
