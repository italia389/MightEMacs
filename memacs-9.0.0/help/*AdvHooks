~bHooks~0

Certain operations during an editing session may be controlled or customized by
assigning the name of a macro to a "hook".  Operations include switching
buffers, reading or writing a file, and executing keys.  When a hook is
triggered, the macro associated with the hook is called with arguments, if
applicable (see below).  If an error occurs during execution or the macro
returns false, an error message is displayed and the hook is disabled.

Note that you cannot assign a command or function to a hook because it makes no
sense to do so.  The one exception is the "wrap" hook which is set indirectly to
the ~uwrapWord~U function via the ~uwrapper~U macro by default (discussed in the ~bLine~0
~bWrapping~0 section).  The ~uwrapWord~U function is designed just for this purpose.

A hook is set or cleared with the ~usetHook~U (~#uC-x h~U) command, usually in a script.
For example, this line from the "memacs.mm" startup file:

    setHook 'help',getHelp

sets the "help" hook to the ~ugetHelp~U macro.  To clear a hook, set it to ~unil~U.
To see all hooks and their settings, enter ~#uC-h h~U (~ushowHooks~U).

The complete list of hooks follows:

    ~bHook name~0   ~bMacro arguments~0     ~bDescription~0

    chDir       (none)              Change-directory hook -- called at program
                                    startup and after the ~uchDir~U command is
                                    executed.

    createBuf   Buffer name         Create-buffer hook -- called at program
                                    startup and immediately after a buffer is
                                    created, with the exception of temporary
                                    buffers (for example, help buffers, which
                                    are created and displayed in pop-up windows,
                                    then deleted).

    exitBuf     (none)              Exit-buffer hook -- called just before
                                    leaving a buffer.  $bufName is the name of
                                    the buffer being exited.  The macro's return
                                    value is passed to the enter-buffer hook.

    enterBuf    exitBuf return      Enter-buffer hook -- called after switching
                 value              to another buffer.  $bufName is the name of
                                    the buffer being entered.

    help        (none)              Help hook -- called when the ~uhelp~U command
                                    is executed.

    mode        $GlobalModes,       Mode-change hook -- called whenever any mode
                 $ShowModes,        is changed.  Arguments are the prior
                 $BufModes          variable values.  (Each argument value can
                                    be compared to the current value of the same
                                    variable to find the mode(s) that changed.)

    preKey      Entered key         Pre-key hook -- called after a key sequence
                                    is entered, but before it is executed.  The
                                    hook macro may set a new key to be executed
                                    by assigning one to the $lastKeySeq
                                    variable.

    postKey     Entered key         Post-key hook -- called immediately after a
                                    key sequence is executed.  The argument is
                                    the same one given to the pre-key hook.
                                    $lastKeySeq will contain the key that was
                                    actually executed.

    read        Buffer name,        Read-file hook -- called after a file is
                 filename           read into a buffer.  The second (filename)
                                    argument will be ~unil~U if standard input was
                                    read.

    write       Buffer name,        Write-file hook -- called just before a
                 filename           buffer is written to disk.

    wrap        (none)              Wrap-word hook -- called when the "Wrap"
                                    buffer mode is enabled, the "RdOnly" buffer
                                    mode is disabled, a space or ~ureturn~U was
                                    entered, and the point is at or past the
                                    wrap column ($wrapCol).
