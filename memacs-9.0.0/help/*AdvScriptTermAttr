~bTerminal Attributes~0

MightEMacs provides the ability to display text in bold, underlined, or reverse
video (or all three) in a window or on the message line.  This is accomplished
by coding special "terminal attribute sequences" in the text that begin with a
tilde (~u~~~U) character.  These sequences turn attributes on or off at the point in
the text where they are entered.  Attribute sequences may be any of the
following:

    ~u~~b~U        Begin bold.
    ~u~~r~U        Begin reverse video.
    ~u~~u~U        Begin underline.
    ~u~~#u~U       Begin underline, skipping spaces.
    ~u~~U~U        End underline.
    ~u~~0~U        End all attributes.
    ~u~~~~~U        Display literal "~~" character.

Note that "bold" and "reverse video" cannot be turned off by themselves -- you
must use ~u~~0~U to turn off all attributes.

To display bolded, reversed, and/or underlined text in a window, do the
following:

    1.  Make the window the current window and enter the desired terminal
        attribute sequences into its buffer.
    2.  Enable processing of the attribute sequences by setting the "TermAttr"
        buffer attribute via the ~ualterBufAttr~U (~#uC-x a~U) command.

Once this is done, the attribute sequences will be converted to the
correspoinding terminal attributes whenever the buffer is displayed in a window.
However, note the following:

    *   The current line in the current window is always displayed in "raw" form
        so that it can be edited.
    *   Attribute sequences will not be converted if the window displaying the
        buffer is horizontally shifted, including a pop-up window.

The process is similar to enable terminal attributes on the message line.  Any
attribute sequences in text produced by the ~ufailure~U, ~usuccess~U, ~uprint~U, ~uprintf~U, and
~uprompt~U functions will be converted if the function is called with n >= 0.
