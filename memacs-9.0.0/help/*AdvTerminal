~bTerminal Dimensions~0

Part of MightEMacs's startup processing is to map its screen to the size of the
terminal window.  The number of columns and rows begin used are saved in the
$TermCols and $TermRows variables.

The editor can also re-map its screen during an editing session if the size of
the terminal window changes; for example, when changing the orientation of a
smart phone from portrait to landscape or vice-versa.  To update the screen
dimensions in MightEMacs after changing the terminal size, use the ~uresetTerm~U
(~#uESC ESC~U) command.
