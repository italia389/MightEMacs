~bModes~0

MightEMacs uses "modes" to activate and deactivate features during the editing
session.  There are two types: ~bglobal~0 and ~bbuffer~0.  Global modes apply to all
buffers, whereas buffer modes (as the name implies) apply only to the buffer in
which they are activated.  Buffer modes are displayed on the mode line of each
window, whereas global modes are displayed only on the mode line of the window
at the bottom of the screen.  Global modes are in parentheses "()" and buffer
modes are in brackets "[]".  Additionally, it is possible to activate a mode but
not display it.  This is controlled by ~bshow~0 modes.

To see all available modes, use the ~ushowModes~U (~#uC-h M~U) command, which will
display all global and buffer mode names, their activation and display status,
and a brief description of each in a pop-up window.  (Modes are described in
detail in Advanced Help.)

Modes are activated, toggled, deactivated, or cleared with the three mode
commands:

    ~ualterGlobalMode~U         ~#uESC m~U
    ~ualterBufMode~U            ~#uC-x m~U
    ~ualterShowMode~U           ~#uC-h m~U

If any of the commands is invoked with a numeric argument less than -1, all
modes of that type are cleared.  Otherwise, each command will prompt for a mode
name (and buffer name, if applicable), then deactivate the mode (n == -1),
toggle it (n == 0, default), activate it (n == 1), or clear all modes first,
then activate it (n > 1).  You may enter the minimum number of characters needed
to uniquely identify a name, ignoring case, and press ~ureturn~U to select it.  For
example, "rd" may be entered for the "RdOnly" buffer mode.
